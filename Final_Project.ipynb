            "{0: 'Dune\\nFrank Herbert\\nCopyright 1965\\nBook 1\\nDUNE\\n', 1: '\\nA beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are\\ncorrect. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of\\nthe life of Muad\\'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born\\nin the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special\\ncare that you locate Muad\\'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be\\ndeceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen\\nyears there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.\\n-from \"Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nIn the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying\\nabout had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the\\nmother of the boy, Paul.\\nIt was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that\\nhad served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that\\ncooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.\\nThe old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul\\'s\\nroom and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.\\nBy the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor,\\nthe awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step\\nahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow -- hair like matted\\nspiderwebs, hooded \\'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.\\n\"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice\\nwheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.\\nPaul\\'s mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to\\nstart late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\"\\n\"So I\\'ve heard, so I\\'ve heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he\\'s already\\nfifteen.\"\\n\"Yes, Your Reverence.\"\\n\"He\\'s awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\"\\nShe chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he\\'s really the Kwisatz\\nHaderach . . . well . . .\"\\nWithin the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two\\nbird-bright ovals -- the eyes of the old woman -- seemed to expand and glow as\\nthey stared into his.\\n\"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you\\'ll\\nneed all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\"\\nAnd she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid\\nthump.\\nPaul lay awake wondering: What\\'s a gom jabbar?\\nIn all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest\\nthing he had seen.\\nYour Reverence.\\nAnd the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench\\ninstead of what she was -- a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke\\'s concubine and mother\\nof the ducal heir.\\n\\n\\x0cIs a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he\\nwondered.\\nHe mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar . . . Kwisatz Haderach.\\nThere had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so\\ndifferent from Caladan that Paul\\'s mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis\\n-- Dune -- Desert Planet.\\nThufir Hawat, his father\\'s Master of Assassins, had explained it: their\\nmortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the\\nplanet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice,\\nmelange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides\\nin fief-complete -- an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said,\\nthis appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular\\namong the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\\n\"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said.\\nArrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.\\nPaul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around\\nhim moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a\\ncathedral as he listened to a faint sound -- the drip-drip-drip of water. Even\\nwhile he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening.\\nHe always remembered the dreams that were predictions.\\nThe dream faded.\\nPaul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking . . .\\nthinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age,\\nperhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted\\nthat the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The\\nplanet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to\\ncommand them: will-o\\'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of\\nthe Imperial Regate.\\nArrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.\\nPaul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body\\nlessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses:\\nhe fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . .\\naortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to\\nbe conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload\\nregions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . .\\nanimal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea\\nthat its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not\\nproduce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the\\nperceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his\\nuniverse . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . .\\nbodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of\\ncell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flow-permanence within . . .\\nOver and over and over within Paul\\'s floating awareness the lesson rolled.\\nWhen dawn touched Paul\\'s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through\\nclosed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the\\ncastle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.\\nThe hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held\\nwith a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes\\nstaring solemnly.\\n\"You\\'re awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nHe studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as\\nshe chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the\\ntension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way -- in the minutiae of\\nobservation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red\\nAtreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\"\\n\"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\"\\n\"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she\\'s the Emperor\\'s\\nTruthsayer. And Paul . . . \" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your\\ndreams.\"\\n\"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\"\\n\"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung\\nthem with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don\\'t keep Reverend\\nMother waiting.\"\\nPaul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What\\'s a gom jabbar?\"\\nAgain, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible\\nhesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.\\nJessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the\\nriver orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You\\'ll learn about . . . the gom jabbar soon\\nenough,\" she said.\\nHe heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.\\nJessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning\\nroom. Please hurry.\"\\nThe Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching\\nmother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving\\nsouthern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family\\nholding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this\\nmorning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and\\nassociation with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here\\nwas a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor\\'s Truthsayer couldn\\'t evade that responsibility\\nwhen the duty call came.\\nDamn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she \\'d borne us a\\ngirl as she was ordered to do!\\nJessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle\\nflick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his\\ndancing master had taught -- the one used \"when in doubt of another\\'s station.\"\\nThe nuances of Paul\\'s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She\\nsaid: \"He\\'s a cautious one, Jessica.\"\\nJessica\\'s hand went to Paul\\'s shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat,\\nfear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. \"Thus he has\\nbeen taught, Your Reverence.\"\\nWhat does she fear? Paul wondered.\\nThe old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like\\nJessica\\'s, but strong bones . . . hair: the Duke\\'s black-black but with browline\\nof the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose;\\nshape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal\\ngrandfather who is dead.\\nNow, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura -- even in death,\\nthe Reverend Mother thought.\\n\"Teaching is one thing,\" she said, \"the basic ingredient is another. We\\nshall see.\" The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. \"Leave us. I enjoin\\nyou to practice the meditation of peace.\"\\nJessica took her hand from Paul\\'s shoulder. \"Your Reverence, I --\"\\n\"Jessica, you know it must be done.\"\\nPaul looked up at his mother, puzzled.\\nJessica straightened. \"Yes . . . of course.\"\\nPaul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother\\'s obvious\\nawe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry apprehension at the\\nfear he sensed radiating from his mother.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Paul . . . \" Jessica took a deep breath. \". . . this test you\\'re about to\\nreceive . . . it\\'s important to me.\"\\n\"Test?\" He looked up at her.\\n\"Remember that you\\'re a duke\\'s son, \"Jessica said. She whirled and strode\\nfrom the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.\\nPaul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. \"Does one dismiss the Lady\\nJessica as though she were a serving wench?\"\\nA smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. \"The Lady Jessica was\\nmy serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school.\" She nodded. \"And a good\\none, too. Now, you come here!\"\\nThe command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could\\nthink about it. Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her gesture,\\nstanding beside her knees.\\n\"See this?\" she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal\\ncube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one\\nside was open -- black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open\\nblackness.\\n\"Put your right hand in the box,\" she said.\\nFear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: \"Is\\nthis how you obey your mother?\"\\nHe looked up into bird-bright eyes.\\nSlowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his\\nhand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around\\nhis hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his\\nhand were asleep.\\nA predatory look filled the old woman\\'s features. She lifted her right hand\\naway from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul\\'s neck. He saw a\\nglint of metal there and started to turn toward\\n\"Stop!\" she snapped.\\nUsing the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.\\n\"I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,\" she said. \"The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It\\'s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don\\'t pull\\naway or you\\'ll feel that poison.\"\\nPaul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from\\nthe seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal\\nteeth that flashed as she spoke.\\n\"A duke\\'s son must know about poisons,\" she said. \"It\\'s the way of our\\ntimes, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your\\nfood. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here\\'s a new one\\nfor you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.\"\\nPride overcame Paul\\'s fear. \"You dare suggest a duke\\'s son is an animal?\" he\\ndemanded.\\n\"Let us say I suggest you may be human,\" she said. \"Steady! I warn you not\\nto try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck\\nbefore you escape me.\"\\n\"Who are you?\" he whispered. \"How did you trick my mother into leaving me\\nalone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?\"\\n\"The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.\" A dry finger touched his\\nneck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.\\n\"Good,\" she said. \"You pass the first test. Now, here\\'s the way of the rest\\nof it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule.\\nKeep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.\"\\nPaul took a deep breath to still his trembling. \"If I call out there\\'ll be\\nservants on you in seconds and you\\'ll die.\"\\n\"Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door.\\nDepend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it\\'s your turn. Be honored. We\\nseldom administer this to men-children.\"\\n\\n\\x0cCuriosity reduced Paul\\'s fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the\\nold woman\\'s voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there . . . if\\nthis were truly a test . . . And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it,\\ntrapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from\\nthe Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit\\nrite.\\n\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that\\nbrings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me\\nand through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its\\npath. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\"\\nHe felt calmness return, said: \"Get on with it, old woman.\"\\n\"Old woman!\" she snapped. \"You\\'ve courage, and that can\\'t be denied. Well,\\nwe shall see, sirra.\" She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a whisper.\\n\"You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand\\nand I\\'ll touch your neck with my gom jabbar -- the death so swift it\\'s like the\\nfall of the headsman\\'s axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you.\\nUnderstand?\"\\n\"What\\'s in the box?\"\\n\"Pain.\"\\nHe felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together.\\nHow could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.\\nThe old woman said; \"You\\'ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a\\ntrap? There\\'s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure\\nthe pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to\\nhis kind.\"\\nThe itch became the faintest burning. \"Why are you doing this?\" he demanded.\\n\"To determine if you\\'re human. Be silent.\"\\nPaul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased\\nin the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat . . . upon heat.\\nHe felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the\\nfingers of the burning hand, but couldn\\'t move them.\\n\"It burns,\" he whispered.\\n\"Silence!\"\\nPain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber cried\\nout to withdraw the hand from that burning pit . . . but . . . the gom jabbar.\\nWithout turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle\\npoised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow\\nhis breaths and couldn\\'t.\\nPain!\\nHis world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the\\nancient face inches away staring at him.\\nHis lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them.\\nThe burning! The burning!\\nHe thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh\\ncrisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.\\nIt stopped!\\nAs though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.\\nPaul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.\\n\"Enough,\" the old woman muttered. \"Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood\\nthat much. I must\\'ve wanted you to fail.\" She leaned back, withdrawing the gom\\njabbar from the side of his neck. \"Take your hand from the box, young human, and\\nlook at it.\"\\nHe fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his hand\\nseemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every movement.\\nReason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box.\\n\"Do it!\" she snapped.\\n\\n\\x0cHe jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No\\nsign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.\\n\"Pain by nerve induction,\" she said. \"Can\\'t go around maiming potential\\nhumans. There\\'re those who\\'d give a pretty for the secret of this box, though.\"\\nShe slipped it into the folds of her gown.\\n\"But the pain --\" he said.\\n\"Pain,\" she sniffed. \"A human can override any nerve in the body.\"\\nPaul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at\\nfour bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to\\nhis side, looked at the old woman. \"You did that to my mother once?\"\\n\"Ever sift sand through a screen?\" she asked.\\nThe tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher\\nawareness: Sand through a screen, he nodded.\\n\"We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.\"\\nHe lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. \"And that\\'s all\\nthere is to it -- pain?\"\\n\"I observed you in pain, lad. Pain\\'s merely the axis of the test. Your\\nmother\\'s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching\\nin you. Our test is crisis and observation.\"\\nHe heard the confirmation in her voice, said: \"It\\'s truth!\"\\nShe stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be\\nthe one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: \"Hope clouds\\nobservation.\"\\n\"You know when people believe what they say,\" she said.\\n\"I know it.\"\\nThe harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She\\nheard them, said: \"Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little\\nbrother, here at my feet.\"\\n\"I prefer to stand.\"\\n\"Your mother sat at my feet once.\"\\n\"I\\'m not my mother.\"\\n\"You hate us a little, eh?\" She looked toward the door, called out:\\n\"Jessica!\"\\nThe door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room.\\nHardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.\\n\"Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?\" the old woman asked.\\n\"I both love and hate you,\" Jessica said. \"The hate -- that\\'s from pains I\\nmust never forget. The love -- that\\'s . . . \"\\n\"Just the basic fact,\" the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. \"You\\nmay come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one\\ninterrupts us.\"\\nJessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to\\nit. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and is . . . human. I knew he was .\\n. . but . . . he lives. Now, I can go on living. The door felt hard and real\\nagainst her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her\\nsenses.\\nMy son lives.\\nPaul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone\\nand think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was\\ndismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke truth. His\\nmother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it . . . the\\npain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove\\nagainst all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been\\ninfected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose\\nwas.\\n\"Some day, lad,\" the old woman said, \"you, too, may have to stand outside a\\ndoor like that. It takes a measure of doing.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the Reverend\\nMother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other\\nvoice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an\\nedge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer\\nthat could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater.\\n\"Why do you test for humans?\" he asked.\\n\"To set you free.\"\\n\"Free?\"\\n\"Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would\\nset them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\"\\n\" \\'Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man\\'s mind,\\' \" Paul\\nquoted.\\n\"Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,\" she said.\\n\"But what the O.C. Bible should\\'ve said is: \\'Thou shalt not make a machine to\\ncounterfeit a human mind.\\' Have you studied the Mentat in your service?\"\\n\"I\\'ve studied with Thufir Hawat.\"\\n\"The Great Revolt took away a crutch,\" she said. \"It forced human minds to\\ndevelop. Schools were started to train human talents. \"\\n\"Bene Gesserit schools?\"\\nShe nodded. \"We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene\\nGesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure\\nmathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.\"\\n\"Politics,\" he said.\\n\"Kull wahad!\" the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.\\n\"I\\'ve not told him. Your Reverence,\" Jessica said.\\nThe Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. \"You did that on\\nremarkably few clues,\" she said. \"Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit\\nschool was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human\\naffairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human\\nstock from animal stock -- for breeding purposes.\"\\nThe old woman\\'s words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He\\nfelt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It\\nwasn\\'t that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said.\\nIt was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.\\nHe said: \"But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don\\'t\\nknow their ancestry.\"\\n\"The genetic lines are always in our records,\" she said. \"Your mother knows\\nthat either she\\'s of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in\\nitself.\"\\n\"Then why couldn\\'t she know who her parents are?\"\\n\"Some do . . . Many don\\'t. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her\\nto a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many\\nreasons.\"\\nAgain, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: \"You take a lot on\\nyourselves.\"\\nThe Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his\\nvoice? \"We carry a heavy burden,\" she said.\\nPaul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He\\nleveled a measuring stare at her, said: \"You say maybe I\\'m the . . . Kwisatz\\nHaderach. What\\'s that, a human gom jabbar?\"\\n\"Paul,\" Jessica said. \"You mustn\\'t take that tone with --\"\\n\"I\\'ll handle this, Jessica,\" the old woman said. \"Now, lad, do you know\\nabout the Truthsayer drug?\"\\n\"You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,\" he said. \"My\\nmother\\'s told me.\"\\n\"Have you ever seen truthtrance?\"\\nHe shook his head. \"No.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"The drug\\'s dangerous,\" she said, \"but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer\\'s\\ngifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory -- in her body\\'s\\nmemory. We look down so many avenues of the past . . . but only feminine\\navenues.\" Her voice took on a note of sadness. \"Yet, there\\'s a place where no\\nTruthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a man will\\ncome one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where\\nwe cannot -- into both feminine and masculine pasts.\"\\n\"Your Kwisatz Haderach?\"\\n\"Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men\\nhave tried the drug . . . so many, but none has succeeded.\"\\n\"They tried and failed, all of them?\"\\n\"Oh, no.\" She shook her head. \"They tried and died.\"\\n', 2: '\\nTo attempt an understanding of Muad\\'Dib without understanding his mortal\\nenemies, the Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood.\\nIt is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.\\n-from \"Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nIt was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the\\nimpetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform\\nstand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork\\nof multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room\\nfrom golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.\\nAn ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the\\ncenter of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them occupied.\\nIn one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with\\nsullen eyes. The other held a slender, short man with effeminate face.\\nBoth youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows\\nspinning it.\\nA chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the\\nchuckle: \"There it is, Piter -- the biggest mantrap in all history. And the\\nDuke\\'s headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron\\nVladimir Harkonnen, do?\"\\n\"Assuredly, Baron,\" said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet,\\nmusical quality.\\nThe fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes\\nin the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind\\nof globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It\\nhad the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines were\\nlaid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest\\ncloud-milk diamonds.\\nThe fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. \"I invite you to\\nobserve,\" the basso voice rumbled. \"Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd-Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south -- these\\nexquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And\\nnowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps\\n-- so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb\\nsetting for a unique Victory.\"\\nA smile touched Piter\\'s lips. \"And to think. Baron: the Padishah Emperor\\nbelieves he\\'s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.\"\\n\"That\\'s a nonsensical statement,\" the Baron rumbled. \"You say this to\\nconfuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.\"\\nThe sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black\\nleotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in\\nthe wall behind him.\\n\\n\\x0cPiter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough\\nto accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and\\nscanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.\\n\"Well?\" the Baron demanded.\\n\"The fool answered us, Baron!\"\\n\"Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?\" the Baron\\nasked. \"Well, what does he say?\"\\n\"He\\'s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as \\'Harkonnen\\' -- no \\'Sire et Cher\\nCousin,\\' no title, nothing.\"\\n\"It\\'s a good name,\" the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his\\nimpatience. \"What does dear Leto say?\"\\n\"He says: \\'Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your\\ntreachery and this all men know.\\' \"\\n\"And?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"He says: \\'The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.\\' He signs it:\\n\\'Duke Leto of Arrakis.\\' \" Piter began to laugh. \"Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is\\nalmost too rich!\"\\n\"Be silent, Piter,\" the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut\\noff with a switch. \"Kanly, is it?\" the Baron asked. \"Vendetta, heh? And he uses\\nthe nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.\"\\n\"You made the peace gesture,\" Piter said. \"The forms have been obeyed.\"\\n\"For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,\" the Baron said. And he thought: I\\nmust do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The\\nBaron stared across the room at his Mental assassin, seeing the feature about\\nhim that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within\\nblue, the eyes without any white in them at all.\\nA grin flashed across Piter\\'s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those\\neyes like holes. \"But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to\\nsee a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for\\nDune -- and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of\\nyou!\"\\nIn a cold voice, the Baron said: \"You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.\"\\n\"But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you . . . you are touched by jealousy.\"\\n\"Piter!\"\\n\"Ah-ah. Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this\\ndelicious scheme by yourself?\"\\n\"Someday I will have you strangled, Piter.\"\\n\"Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?\"\\n\"Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?\"\\n\"Truth without fear surprises the Baron,\" Piter said. His face drew down\\ninto a caricature of a frowning mask. \"Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know as a\\nMentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I\\nam useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I\\'m yet of much use. I know what\\nit is you learned from that lovely Dune planet -- waste not. True, Baron?\"\\nThe Baron continued to stare at Piter.\\nFeyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My\\nuncle cannot talk to his Mental without arguing. Do they think I\\'ve nothing to\\ndo except listen their arguments?\\n\"Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"I told you to listen and learn when I invited you\\nin here. Are you learning?\"\\n\"Yes, Uncle.\" the voice was carefully subservient.\\n\"Sometimes I wonder about Piter,\" the Baron said. \"I cause pain out of\\nnecessity, but he . . . I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I\\ncan feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon,\\nand that\\'ll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand\\ndirected the pliant doctor . . . and knowing that will be a terrible thing.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Then why haven\\'t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs\\nquietly and efficiently?\" Piter asked. \"You talk of pity, but --\"\\n\"The Duke must know when I encompass his doom,\" the Baron said. \"And the\\nother Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. I\\'ll\\ngain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don\\'t have to\\nlike it.\"\\n\"Room to maneuver,\" Piter sneered. \"Already you have the Emperor\\'s eyes on\\nyou, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two\\nof his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that\\'ll be an end to the Baron\\nVladimir Harkonnen.\"\\n\"You\\'d like to see that, wouldn\\'t you, Piter?\" the Baron asked. \"You\\'d enjoy\\nseeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle.\\nYou\\'d truly enjoy that.\"\\n\"Does the Baron need to ask?\" Piter whispered.\\n\"You should\\'ve been a Bashar of the Corps,\" the Baron said. \"You\\'re too\\ninterested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the\\nspoils of Arrakis.\"\\nPiter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly\\nbehind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth\\nlooked up at Piter with a worried frown.\\n\"Do not toy with Piter, Baron,\" Piter said. \"You promised me the Lady\\nJessica. You promised her to me.\"\\n\"For what, Piter?\" the Baron asked. \"For pain?\"\\nPiter stared at him, dragging out the silence.\\nFeyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: \"Uncle, do I have\\nto stay? You said you\\'d --\"\\n\"My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,\" the Baron said. He moved within\\nthe shadows beside the globe. \"Patience, Feyd.\" And he turned his attention back\\nto the Mentat. \"What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?\"\\n\"The trap will bring him to you, Baron,\" Piter muttered.\\n\"That\\'s not my question,\" the Baron said. \"You\\'ll recall that you predicted\\nthe Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh,\\nMentat?\"\\n\"I\\'m not often wrong, Baron,\" Piter said, and for the first time there was\\nfear in his voice. \"Give me that: I\\'m not often wrong. And you know yourself\\nthese Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor\\'s consort had\\nproduced only females.\"\\n\"Uncle,\" said Feyd-Rautha, \"you said there\\'d be something important here for\\nme to --\"\\n\"Listen to my nephew,\" the Baron said. \"He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he\\ncannot rule himself.\" The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among\\nshadows. \"Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, I summoned you here hoping to teach\\nyou a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should\\'ve learned\\nsomething from this exchange.\"\\n\"But, Uncle --\"\\n\"A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn\\'t you say, Feyd?\"\\n\"Yes, but --\"\\n\"Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at\\nhis eyes! He might\\'ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient,\\nPiter, but he\\'s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient,\\nPiter, but he still can err.\"\\nPiter spoke in a low, sullen tone: \"Did you call me in here to impair my\\nefficiency with criticism, Baron?\"\\n\"Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my\\nnephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.\"\\n\"Are you already training my replacement?\" Piter demanded.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your\\ncunning and venom?\"\\n\"The same place you found me, Baron.\"\\n\"Perhaps I should at that,\" the Baron mused. \"You do seem a bit unstable\\nlately. And the spice you eat!\"\\n\"Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?\"\\n\"My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to\\nthat? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.\"\\n\"Then I\\'m on display,\" Piter said. \"Shall I dance? Shall I perform my\\nvarious functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau-\"\\n\"Precisely,\" the Baron said. \"You are on display. Now, be silent.\" He\\nglanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew\\'s lips, the full and pouting look of\\nthem, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. \"This is\\na Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties.\\nThe fact that it\\'s encased in a human body, however, must not be overlooked. A\\nserious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with their thinking\\nmachines had the right idea.\"\\n\"They were toys compared to me,\" Piter snarled. \"You yourself, Baron, could\\noutperform those machines.\"\\n\"Perhaps,\" the Baron said. \"Ah, well . . . \" He took a deep breath, belched.\\n\"Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against\\nthe House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.\"\\n\"Baron, I\\'ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My\\nobservations of --\"\\n\"I\\'ll be the judge of this,\" the Baron said. \"I give you an order, Mentat.\\nPerform one of your various functions.\"\\n\"So be it,\" Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity\\n-- as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. \"In a\\nfew days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a\\nSpacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of\\nArrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke\\'s Mentat, Thufir Hawat,\\nwill have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.\"\\n\"Listen carefully, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"Observe the plans within plans\\nwithin plans.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is\\nletting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his\\nheir.\\n\"There are several tangential possibilities,\" Piter said. \"I indicate that\\nHouse Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility\\nthe Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety\\noutside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses,\\ntaking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium.\"\\n\"The Duke\\'s too proud a man for that,\" the Baron said.\\n\"It is a possibility,\" Piter said. \"The ultimate effect for us would be the\\nsame, however.\"\\n\"No, it would not!\" the Baron growled. \"I must have him dead and his line\\nended.\"\\n\"That\\'s the high probability,\" Piter said. \"There are certain preparations\\nthat indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none\\nof these things.\"\\n\"So,\" the Baron sighed. \"Get on with it, Piter.\"\\n\"At Arrakeen,\" Piter said, \"the Duke and his family will occupy the\\nResidency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.\"\\n\"The Ambassador to the Smugglers,\" the Baron chuckled.\\n\"Ambassador to what?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Your uncle makes a joke,\" Piter said. \"He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to\\nthe Smugglers, indicating the Emperor\\'s interest in smuggling operations on\\nArrakis.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. \"Why?\"\\n\"Don\\'t be dense, Feyd,\" the Baron snapped. \"As long as the Guild remains\\neffectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could\\nspies and assassins move about?\"\\nFeyd-Rautha\\'s mouth made a soundless \"Oh-h-h-h.\"\\n\"We\\'ve arranged diversions at the Residency,\" Piter said. \"There\\'ll be an\\nattempt on the life of the Atreides heir -- an attempt which could succeed.\"\\n\"Piter,\" the Baron rumbled, \"you indicated --\"\\n\"I indicated accidents can happen,\" Piter said. \"And the attempt must appear\\nvalid.\"\\n\"Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,\" the Baron said. \"Of course,\\nhe\\'s potentially more dangerous than the father . . . with that witch mother\\ntraining him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.\"\\n\"Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,\" Piter said.\\n\"The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has\\ninvestigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial\\nConditioning -- supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great\\nstore is set on Imperial Conditioning. It\\'s assumed that ultimate conditioning\\ncannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once\\nobserved, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that\\nmoved the doctor.\"\\n\"How?\" Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew\\nyou couldn\\'t subvert Imperial Conditioning!\\n\"Another time,\" the Baron said. \"Continue, Piter.\"\\n\"In place of Yueh,\" Piter said, \"we\\'ll drag a most interesting suspect\\nacross Hawat\\'s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to\\nHawat\\'s attention.\"\\n\"Her?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\n\"The Lady Jessica herself,\" the Baron said.\\n\"Is it not sublime?\" Piter asked. \"Hawat\\'s mind will be so filled with this\\nprospect it\\'ll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.\"\\nPiter frowned, then: \"But I don\\'t think he\\'ll be able to carry it off.\"\\n\"You don\\'t want him to, eh?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"Don\\'t distract me,\" Piter said. \"While Hawat\\'s occupied with the Lady\\nJessica, we\\'ll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the\\nlike. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he\\'s gaining a measure of\\nsecurity. Then, when the moment is ripe, we\\'ll signal Yueh and move in with our\\nmajor force . . . ah . . . \"\\n\"Go ahead, tell him all of it,\" the Baron said.\\n\"We\\'ll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in\\nHarkonnen livery.\"\\n\"Sardaukar!\" Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial\\ntroops, the killers without mercy, the soldier fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.\\n\"You see how I trust you, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"No hint of this must ever\\nreach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial\\nHouse and there\\'d be chaos.\"\\n\"The main point,\" Piter said, \"is this: since House Harkonnen is being used\\nto do the Imperial dirty work, we\\'ve gained a true advantage. It\\'s a dangerous\\nadvantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen\\ngreater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.\"\\n\"You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"Not\\nin your wildest imaginings. To begin, we\\'ll have an irrevocable directorship in\\nthe CHOAM Company.\"\\n\\n\\x0cFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each\\nnoble House dipping from the company\\'s coffers whatever it could under the power\\nof the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships -- they were the real evidence\\nof political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength\\nwithin the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his\\nsupporters.\\n\"The Duke Leto,\" Piter said, \"may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum\\nalong the desert\\'s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined\\nsecurity. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty\\'s agents -- the\\nplanetary ecologist. You may remember him -- Kynes.\"\\n\"Feyd remembers him,\" the Baron said. \"Get on with it.\"\\n\"You do not drool very prettily, Baron,\" Piter said.\\n\"Get on with it, I command you!\" the Baron roared.\\nPiter shrugged. \"If matters go as planned,\" he said, \"House Harkonnen will\\nhave a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have\\ndispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.\"\\n\"More profits,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\\n\"Indeed,\" the Baron said. And he thought: It\\'s only just. We\\'re the ones who\\ntamed Arrakis . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the\\ndesert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as\\nthe native labor pool.\\n\"And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,\"\\nPiter said. \"They will know.\"\\n\"They will know,\" the Baron breathed.\\n\"Loveliest of all,\" Piter said, \"is that the Duke will know, too. He knows\\nnow. He can already feel the trap.\"\\n\"It\\'s true the Duke knows,\" the Baron said, and his voice held a note of\\nsadness. \"He could not help but know . . . more\\'s the pity.\"\\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged from\\nthe shadows, his figure took on dimension -- grossly and immensely fat. And with\\nsubtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was\\nsustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh\\ntwo hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than\\nfifty of them.\\n\"I am hungry,\" the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a\\nberinged hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. \"Send for\\nfood, my darling. We will eat before we retire.\"\\n', 3: '\\nThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: \"The Reverend Mother must combine the\\nseductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess,\\nholding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure.\\nFor when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once\\noccupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.\"\\n-from \"Muad\\'Dib, Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"Well, Jessica, what have you to say for yourself?\" asked the Reverend\\nMother.\\nIt was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul\\'s ordeal.

A skinny girl with\\nhair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had entered\\n\\n\\x0cthe study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the\\nBene Gesserit school on Wallach IX.

What do I want you to say?\" The old voice\\ncarried a tone of cruel mimicry.\\n\"So I had a son!\" Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into\\nthis anger deliberately.\\n\"You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.\"\\n\"It meant so much to him,\" Jessica pleaded.\\n\"And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!\"\\nJessica lifted her chin. \"I sensed the possibility.\"\\n\"You thought only of your Duke\\'s desire for a son,\" the old woman snapped.\\n\"And his desires don\\'t figure in this.

It\\'d be bad enough without the complication of a\\nfeudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.\"\\nJessica spoke bitterly: \"Chips in the path of the flood -- and this chip\\nhere, this is the Duke Leto, and this one\\'s his son, and this one\\'s --\"\\n\"Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate\\nedge you walked.\"\\n\" \\'I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,\\' \" Jessica quoted.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Truth.\" the old woman said. \"And all we can hope for now is to prevent this\\nfrom erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the key\\nbloodlines.\"\\nJessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She\\nfought down the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the\\nragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, \"I\\'ll pay for my\\nown mistake.\"\\n\"And your son will pay with you.\"\\n\"I\\'ll shield him as well as I\\'m able.\"\\n\"Shield!\" the old woman snapped. \"You well know the weakness there! Shield\\nyour son too much, Jessica, and he\\'ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any\\ndestiny.\"\\nJessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. \"Is it\\nreally that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?\"\\n\"Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there\\nand softened it up somewhat.\" The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her feet,\\nstraightened a fold in her gown. \"Call the boy in here. I must be leaving soon.\"\\n\"Must you?\"\\nThe old woman\\'s voice softened. \"Jessica, girl, I wish I could stand in your\\nplace and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path.\"\\n\"I know.\"\\n\"You\\'re as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that\\ninterfere with duty.\"\\n\"I understand . . . the necessity.\"\\n\"What you did, Jessica, and why you did it -- we both know. But kindness\\nforces me to tell you there\\'s little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit\\nTotality. You mustn\\'t let yourself hope too much.\"\\nJessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture.\\n\"You make me feel like a little girl again -- reciting my first lesson.\" She\\nforced the words out: \" \\'Humans must never submit to animals.\\' \" A dry sob shook\\nher. In a low voice, she said: \"I\\'ve been so lonely.\"\\n\"It should be one of the tests,\" the old woman said. \"Humans are almost\\nalways lonely. Now summon the boy. He\\'s had a long, frightening day. But he\\'s\\nhad time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions about these\\ndreams of his.\"\\nJessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it.\\n\"Paul, come in now, please.\"\\nPaul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though she\\nwere a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the Reverend\\nMother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal. He heard his\\nmother close the door behind him.\\n\"Young man,\" the old woman said, \"let\\'s return to this dream business.\"\\n\"What do you want?\"\\n\"Do you dream every night?\"\\n\"Not dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some are\\nworth remembering and some aren\\'t.\"\\n\"How do you know the difference?\"\\n\"I just know it.\"\\nThe old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. \"What did you dream last\\nnight? Was it worth remembering?\"\\n\"Yes.\" Paul closed his eyes. \"I dreamed a cavern . . . and water . . . and a\\ngirl there -- very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in\\nthem. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on\\nCaladan.\" Paul opened his eyes.\\n\"And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen\\ntoday?\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul thought about this, then: \"Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a\\nstamp of strangeness on me.\"\\n\"Stamp of strangeness,\" the old woman breathed, and again she shot a glance\\nat Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. \"Tell me truly now, Paul, do you\\noften have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?\"\\n\"Yes. And I\\'ve dreamed about that girl before.\"\\n\"Oh? You know her?\"\\n\"I will know her.\"\\n\"Tell me about her.\"\\nAgain, Paul closed his eyes. \"We\\'re in a little place in some rocks where\\nit\\'s sheltered. It\\'s almost night, but it\\'s hot and I can see patches of sand\\nout of an opening in the rocks. We\\'re . . . waiting for something . . . for me\\nto go meet some people. And she\\'s frightened but trying to hide it from me, and\\nI\\'m excited. And she says: \\'Tell me about the waters of your homeworld, Usul.\\' \"\\nPaul opened his eyes. \"Isn\\'t that strange? My homeworld\\'s Caladan. I\\'ve never\\neven heard of a planet called Usul.\"\\n\"Is there more to this dream?\" Jessica prompted.\\n\"Yes. But maybe she was calling me Usul,\" Paul said. \"I just thought of\\nthat.\" Again, he closed his eyes. \"She asks me to tell her about the waters. And\\nI take her hand. And I say I\\'ll tell her a poem. And I tell her the poem, but I\\nhave to explain some of the words -- like beach and surf and seaweed and\\nseagulls.\"\\n\"What poem?\" the Reverend Mother asked.\\nPaul opened his eyes. \"It\\'s just one of Gurney Halleck\\'s tone poems for sad\\ntimes.\"\\nBehind Paul Jessica began to recite:\\n\"I remember salt smoke from a beach fire\\nAnd shadows under the pines -Solid, clean . . . fixed -Seagulls perched at the tip of land,\\nWhite upon green . . .\\nAnd a wind comes through the pines\\nTo sway the shadows;\\nThe seagulls spread their wings,\\nLift\\nAnd fill the sky with screeches.\\nAnd I hear the wind\\nBlowing across our beach,\\nAnd the surf,\\nAnd I see that our fire\\nHas scorched the seaweed.\"\\n\"That\\'s the one,\" Paul said.\\nThe old woman stared at Paul, then: \"Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene\\nGesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of us.\\nYour mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a\\nmother. Possibility I see, too, but no more.\"\\nShe fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her\\nout.\\nPresently, she said: \"As you will, then. You\\'ve depths in you; that I\\'ll\\ngrant.\"\\n\"May I go now?\" he asked.\\n\"Don\\'t you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the\\nKwisatz Haderach?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"She said those who tried for it died.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"But I can help you with a few hints at why they failed,\" the Reverend\\nMother said.\\nShe talks of hints, Paul thought. She doesn\\'t really know anything. And he\\nsaid: \"Hint then.\"\\n\"And be damned to me?\" She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old\\nface. \"Very well: \\'That which submits rules.\\' \"\\nHe felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as\\ntension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all?\\n\"That\\'s a hint?\" he asked.\\n\"We\\'re not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning,\" the old woman\\nsaid. \"The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many\\nwillows -- a wall against the wind. This is the willow\\'s purpose.\"\\nPaul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him,\\nreinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her:\\nfatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.\\n\"You think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach,\" he said. \"You talk about me,\\nbut you haven\\'t said one thing about what we can do to help my father. I\\'ve\\nheard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my father were dead. Well, he\\nisn\\'t!\"\\n\"If there were a thing to be done for him, we\\'d have done it,\" the old woman\\ngrowled. \"We may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible. But for your\\nfather, nothing. When you\\'ve learned to accept that as a fact, you\\'ve learned a\\nreal Bene Gesserit lesson.\"\\nPaul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How\\ncould she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His mind\\nseethed with resentment.\\nThe Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. \"You\\'ve been training him in the Way\\n-- I\\'ve seen the signs of it. I\\'d have done the same in your shoes and devil\\ntake the Rules.\"\\nJessica nodded.\\n\"Now, I caution you,\" said the old woman, \"to ignore the regular order of\\ntraining. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it,\\nbut we both know how much more he needs . . . and that desperately.\" She stepped\\nclose to Paul, stared down at him. \"Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it.\\nBut if you don\\'t -- well, we shall yet succeed.\"\\nOnce more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed\\nbetween them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing, with\\nnot another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from\\nher thoughts.\\nBut Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother\\'s face as she\\nturned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were more\\nunnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.\\n', 4: '\\nYou have read that Muad\\'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers\\nwere too great. But Muad\\'Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was\\nGurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney\\'s songs, as\\nyou read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of\\nAssassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There\\nwere Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name\\nblack in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son\\nin the Bene Gesserit Way, and -- of course -- the Duke Leto, whose qualities as\\na father have long been overlooked.\\n-from \"A Child\\'s History of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\n\\x0cThufir Hawat slipped into the training room of Castle Caladan, closed the\\ndoor softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm-leathered.\\nHis left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of the Old\\nDuke.\\nThree generations of them now, he thought.\\nHe stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through\\nthe skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and\\ncharts spread across an ell table.\\nHow many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to\\na door? Hawat cleared his throat.\\nPaul remained bent over his studies.\\nA cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat.\\nPaul straightened, spoke without turning: \"I know. I\\'m sitting with my back\\nto a door.\"\\nHawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.\\nPaul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table.\\nHawat\\'s eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face.\\n\"I heard you coming down the hall,\" Paul said. \"And I heard you open the\\ndoor.\"\\n\"The sounds I make could be imitated.\"\\n\"I\\'d know the difference.\"\\nHe might at that, Hawat thought. That witch-mother of his is giving him the\\ndeep training, certainly. I wonder what her precious school thinks of that?\\nMaybe that\\'s why they sent the old Proctor here -- to whip our dear Lady Jessica\\ninto line.\\nHawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did\\nit pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place\\nsuddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to\\nArrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms\\nquiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an\\nancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.\\nThere stand I, Hawat thought.\\n\"Thufir, what\\'re you thinking?\" Paul asked.\\nHawat looked at the boy. \"I was thinking we\\'ll all be out of here soon and\\nlikely never see the place again.\"\\n\"Does that make you sad?\"\\n\"Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.\"\\nHe glanced at the charts on the table. \"And Arrakis is just another place.\"\\n\"Did my father send you up to test me?\"\\nHawat scowled -- the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded.\\n\"You\\'re thinking it\\'d have been nicer if he\\'d come up himself, but you must know\\nhow busy he is. He\\'ll be along later.\"\\n\"I\\'ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.\"\\n\"The storms. I see.\"\\n\"They sound pretty bad.\"\\n\"That\\'s too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven\\nthousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push -coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They\\ncan blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose\\nthat\\'s in their way -- sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and\\netch the bones to slivers.\"\\n\"Why don\\'t they have weather control?\"\\n\"Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there\\'d be maintenance\\nand the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and\\nyour father\\'s House isn\\'t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.\"\\n\"Have you ever seen the Fremen?\"\\nThe lad\\'s mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Like as not I have seen them,\" he said. \"There\\'s little to tell them from\\nthe folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And\\nthey stink to heaven in any closed space. It\\'s from those suits they wear -call them \\'stillsuits\\' -- that reclaim the body\\'s own water.\"\\nPaul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a\\ndream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their\\nbody moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. \"Water\\'s precious there,\"\\nhe said.\\nHawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I\\'m doing it, getting across to him the\\nimportance of this planet as an enemy. It\\'s madness to go in there without that\\ncaution in our minds.\\nPaul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the\\nspreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. \"Water,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'ll learn a great concern for water,\" Hawat said. \"As the Duke\\'s son\\nyou\\'ll never want for it, but you\\'ll see the pressures of thirst all around\\nyou.\"\\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and\\nthe ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water\\nstarvation.\\n\"You\\'ll learn about the funeral plains,\" she\\'d said, \"about the wilderness\\nthat is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the\\nsandworms. You\\'ll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean\\na hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You\\'ll ride upon your own two\\nfeet without \\'thopter or groundcar or mount.\"\\nAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone -- singsong and wavering -- than\\nby her words.\\n\"When you live upon Arrakis,\" she had said, \"khala, the land is empty. The\\nmoons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.\"\\nPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding\\nthe door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: \"Do you see no hope.\\nYour Reverence?\"\\n\"Not for the father.\" And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked\\ndown at Paul. \"Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four\\nthings . . . \" She held up four big-knuckled fingers. \". . . the learning of the\\nwise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of\\nthe brave. But all of these are as nothing . . . \" She closed her fingers into a\\nfist. \". . . without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science\\nof your tradition!\"\\nA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were\\nonly now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room\\nwith Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the\\nMentat\\'s puzzled frown.\\n\"Where were you woolgathering that time?\" Hawat asked.\\n\"Did you meet the Reverend Mother?\"\\n\"That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?\" Hawat\\'s eyes quickened with\\ninterest. \"I met her.\"\\n\"She . . . \" Paul hesitated, found that he couldn\\'t tell Hawat about the\\nordeal. The inhibitions went deep.\\n\"Yes? What did she?\"\\nPaul took two deep breaths. \"She said a thing.\" He closed his eyes, calling\\nup the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old\\nwoman\\'s tone: \" \\'You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you\\nmust learn to rule. It\\'s something none of your ancestors learned.\\' \" Paul\\nopened his eyes, said: \"That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire\\nplanet. And she said, \\'He\\'s losing it.\\' And I said my father was getting a\\nricher planet. And she said. \\'He\\'ll lose that one, too.\\' And I wanted to run and\\n\\n\\x0cwarn my father, but she said he\\'d already been warned -- by you, by Mother, by\\nmany people.\"\\n\"True enough,\" Hawat muttered.\\n\"Then why\\'re we going?\" Paul demanded.\\n\"Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there\\'s hope in spite of what\\nthat witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?\"\\nPaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table.\\nSlowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he\\nthought. How?\\n\"She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,\" Paul said. \"And I said that\\none commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.\"\\nShe hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to\\ncontinue.\\n\"She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must\\nlay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.\"\\n\"How\\'d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?\" Hawat\\nasked.\\nPaul shrugged. \"Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world\\'s\\nlanguage, that it\\'s different for every world. And I thought she meant they\\ndidn\\'t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn\\'t it at all. She said she\\nmeant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don\\'t hear\\njust with your ears. And I said that\\'s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.\"\\nHawat chuckled. \"How\\'d that sit with her?\"\\n\"I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn\\'t a problem to solve,\\nbut a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: \\'A\\nprocess cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the\\nflow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\\' That seemed to satisfy\\nher.\"\\nHe seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened\\nhim. Why did she do it?\\n\"Thufir,\" Paul said, \"will Arrakis be as bad as she said?\"\\n\"Nothing could be that bad,\" Hawat said and forced a smile. \"Take those\\nFremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation\\nanalysis, I can tell you there\\'re many, many more of them than the Imperium\\nsuspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and . . .\" Hawat put a\\nsinewy finger beside his eye. \". . . they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion.\\nYou must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father\\'s\\nhelper.\"\\n\"My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,\" Paul said. \"Do you know, Thufir,\\nit sounds much like Arrakis . . . perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.\"\\n\"We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,\" Hawat said. \"Only what it\\nwas like long ago . . . mostly. But what is known -- you\\'re right on that\\nscore.\"\\n\"Will the Fremen help us?\"\\n\"It\\'s a possibility.\" Hawat stood up. \"I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile,\\nyou take care of yourself for an old man who\\'s fond of you, heh? Come around\\nhere like the good lad and sit facing the door. It\\'s not that I think there\\'s\\nany danger in the castle; it\\'s just a habit I want you to form.\"\\nPaul got to his feet, moved around the table. \"You\\'re going today?\"\\n\"Today it is, and you\\'ll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it\\'ll be\\non the soil of your new world.\" He gripped Paul\\'s right arm at the bicep. \"Keep\\nyour knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.\" He released the arm,\\npatted Paul\\'s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\\n\"Thufir! \"Paul called.\\nHawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\\n\"Don\\'t sit with your back to any doors,\" Paul said.\\n\\n\\x0cA grin spread across the seamed old face. \"That I won\\'t, lad. Depend on it.\"\\nAnd he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.\\nPaul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day\\nhere, he thought. He looked around the room. We \\'re leaving. The idea of\\ndeparture was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He\\nrecalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of\\nmany things -- the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides,\\nthe suns -- the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense\\nof the now. And he wondered: What is the now?\\nThe door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched\\nthrough it preceded by a handful of weapons.\\n\"Well, Gurney Halleck,\" Paul called, \"are you the new weapons master?\"\\nHalleck kicked the door shut with one heel. \"You\\'d rather I came to play\\ngames, I know,\" he said. He glanced abound the room, noting that Hawat\\'s men\\nalready had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke\\'s heir. The subtle\\ncode signs were all around.\\nPaul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward\\nthe training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung\\nover Gurney\\'s shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the\\nhead of the fingerboard.\\nHalleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up -- the\\nrapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts.\\nThe inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across\\nthe room.\\n\"So you don\\'t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,\" Halleck said.\\n\"And what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man\\nrunning to his enemy\\'s funeral.\"\\nPaul grinned. Of all his father\\'s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew\\nthe man\\'s moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a friend\\nthan as a hired sword.\\nHalleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. \"If y\\' won\\'t\\ntalk, y\\' won\\'t,\" he said.\\nPaul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: \"Well, Gurney, do we come\\nprepared for music when it\\'s fighting time?\"\\n\"So it\\'s sass for our elders today,\" Halleck said. He tried a chord on the\\ninstrument, nodded.\\n\"Where\\'s Duncan Idaho?\" Paul asked. \"Isn\\'t he supposed to be teaching me\\nweaponry?\"\\n\"Duncan\\'s gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,\" Halleck said. \"All you\\nhave left is poor Gurney who\\'s fresh out of fight and spoiling for music.\" He\\nstruck another chord, listened to it, smiled. \"And it was decided in council\\nthat you being such a poor fighter we\\'d best teach you the music trade so\\'s you\\nwon\\'t waste your life entire.\"\\n\"Maybe you\\'d better sing me a lay then,\" Paul said. \"I want to be sure how\\nnot to do it.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h, hah!\" Gurney laughed, and he swung into \"Galacian Girls.\" his\\nmultipick a blur over the strings as he sang:\\n\"Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls\\nWill do it for pearls,\\nAnd the Arrakeen for water!\\nBut if you desire dames\\nLike consuming flames,\\nTry a Caladanin daughter!\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick,\" Paul said, \"but if my mother\\nheard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she\\'d have your ears on the\\nouter wall for decoration.\"\\nGurney pulled at his left ear. \"Poor decoration, too, they having been\\nbruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced some\\nstrange ditties on his baliset.\"\\n\"So you\\'ve forgotten what it\\'s like to find sand in your bed,\" Paul said. He\\npulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. \"Then,\\nlet\\'s fight!\"\\nHalleck\\'s eyes went wide in mock surprise. \"So! It was your wicked hand did\\nthat deed! Guard yourself today, young master -- guard yourself.\" He grabbed up\\na rapier, laced the air with it. \"I\\'m a hellfiend out for revenge!\"\\nPaul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile,\\none foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.\\n\"What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,\" Paul intoned. \"This doltish\\nGurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and\\nshielded.\" Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin\\ntingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard\\nexternal sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. \"In shield\\nfighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack,\" Paul said. \"Attack has the\\nsole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the\\nattack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!\" Paul\\nsnapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed\\nto enter a shield\\'s mindless defenses.\\nHalleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted\\nblade pass his chest. \"Speed, excellent,\" he said. \"But you were wide open for\\nan underhanded counter with a slip-tip.\"\\nPaul stepped back, chagrined.\\n\"I should whap your backside for such carelessness,\" Halleck said. He lifted\\na naked kindjal from the table and held it up. \"This in the hand of an enemy can\\nlet out your life\\'s blood! You\\'re an apt pupil, none better, but I\\'ve warned you\\nthat not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his\\nhand.\"\\n\"I guess I\\'m not in the mood for it today,\" Paul said.\\n\"Mood?\" Halleck\\'s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield\\'s\\nfiltering. \"What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises -no matter the mood! Mood\\'s a thing for cattle or making love or playing the\\nbaliset. It\\'s not for fighting.\"\\n\"I\\'m sorry, Gurney.\"\\n\"You\\'re not sorry enough!\"\\nHalleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left\\nhand, the rapier poised high in his right. \"Now I say guard yourself for true!\"\\nHe leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.\\nPaul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges\\ntouched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact\\nalong his skin. What\\'s gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He\\'s not faking\\nthis! Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist\\nsheath.\\n\"You see a need for an extra blade, eh?\" Halleck grunted.\\nIs this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!\\nAround the room they fought -- thrust and parry, feint and counterfeint. The\\nair within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the slow\\ninterchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new shield\\ncontact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.\\nPaul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise\\ntable. If I can turn him beside the table, I\\'ll show him a trick, Paul thought.\\nOne more step, Gurney.\\n\\n\\x0cHalleck took the step.\\nPaul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck\\'s rapier catch against\\nthe table\\'s edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in\\nacross Halleck\\'s neckline with the bodkin. He stopped the blade an inch from the\\njugular.\\n\"Is this what you seek?\" Paul whispered.\\n\"Look down, lad,\" Gurney panted.\\nPaul obeyed, saw Halleck\\'s kindjal thrust under the table\\'s edge, the tip\\nalmost touching Paul\\'s groin.\\n\"We\\'d have joined each other in death,\" Halleck said. \"But I\\'ll admit you\\nfought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood.\" And he\\ngrinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.\\n\"The way you came at me,\" Paul said. \"Would you really have drawn my blood?\"\\nHalleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. \"If you\\'d fought one whit\\nbeneath your abilities. I\\'d have scratched you a good one, a scar you\\'d\\nremember. I\\'ll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who\\nhappens along.\"\\nPaul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. \"I\\ndeserved that, Gurney. But it would\\'ve angered my father if you\\'d hurt me. I\\'ll\\nnot have you punished for my failing.\"\\n\"As to that,\" Halleck said, \"it was my failing, too. And you needn\\'t worry\\nabout a training scar or two. You\\'re lucky you have so few. As to your father -the Duke\\'d punish me only if I failed to make a first-class fighting man out of\\nyou. And I\\'d have been failing there if I hadn\\'t explained the fallacy in this\\nmood thing you\\'ve suddenly developed.\"\\nPaul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.\\n\"It\\'s not exactly play we do here,\" Halleck said.\\nPaul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness\\nin Halleck\\'s manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored\\ninkvine scar on the man\\'s jaw, remembering the story of how it had been put\\nthere by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a\\nsudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even for an instant. It occurred to\\nPaul, then, that the making of Halleck\\'s scar had been accompanied by pain -- a\\npain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this\\nthought aside; it chilled their world.\\n\"I guess I did hope for some play today,\" Paul said. \"Things are so serious\\naround here lately.\"\\nHalleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes.\\nThere was pain in him -- like a blister, all that was left of some lost\\nyesterday that Time had pruned off him.\\nHow soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon he\\nmust read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to enter\\nthe necessary fact on the necessary line: \"Please list your next of kin.\"\\nHalleck spoke without turning: \"I sensed the play in you, lad, and I\\'d like\\nnothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we\\ngo to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.\"\\nPaul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.\\nHalleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He gestured\\nto the practice dummy. \"Now, we\\'ll work on your timing. Let me see you catch\\nthat thing sinister. I\\'ll control it from over here where I can have a full view\\nof the action. And I warn you I\\'ll be trying new counters today. There\\'s a\\nwarning you\\'d not get from a real enemy.\"\\nPaul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with\\nthe sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He\\ncrossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and\\nfelt the defensive field forcing his blade away.\\n\"En garde!\" Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul activated his shield, parried and countered.\\nHalleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two\\nparts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in\\nfly-buzz.\\nI\\'m the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings\\nand abilities and all of them grafted onto me -- all bearing for someone else to\\npick.\\nFor some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in\\nhis mind. But she was dead now -- in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She\\nhad loved pansies . . . or was it daisies? He couldn\\'t remember. It bothered him\\nthat he couldn\\'t remember.\\nPaul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand\\nentretisser.\\nThat clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul\\'s interweaving\\nhand motions. He\\'s been practicing and studying on his own. That\\'s not Duncan\\'s\\nstyle, and it\\'s certainly nothing I\\'ve taught him.\\nThis thought only added to Halleck\\'s sadness. I\\'m infected by mood, he\\nthought. And he began to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully\\nto his pillow throbbing in the night.\\n\"If wishes were fishes we\\'d all cast nets,\" he murmured.\\nIt was his mother\\'s expression and he always used it when he felt the\\nblackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that was to\\nbe taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.\\n', 5: '\\nYUEH (yu\\'e), Wellington (weling-tun), Stdrd 10,082-10,191; medical doctor of the\\nSuk School (grd Stdrd 10,112); md: Wanna Marcus, B.G.

He felt excitement that his father would\\nbe coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor\\'s command to\\ntake over the fief of Arrakis.\\nYueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these\\npast few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: I\\nmust not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt\\nby the Harkonnen beasts.\\nPaul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. \"What\\'ll I be studying\\non the way across?\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Ah-h-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have\\nopened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It\\'s not clear how.

I play the hypocrite even with myself.\\n\"Will there be something on the Fremen?\" Paul asked.\\n\"The Fremen?\" Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at\\nthe nervous motion, withdrew his hand.\\n\"Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,\" Paul said.\\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" Yueh said. \"There are two general separations of the\\npeople -- Fremen, they are one group, and the others are the people of the\\ngraben, the sink, and the pan. There\\'s some intermarriage, I\\'m told. The women\\nof pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives.\\nThey have a saying: \\'Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.\\' \"\\n\"Do you have pictures of them?\"\\n\"I\\'ll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is\\ntheir eyes -- totally blue, no whites in them.\"\\n\"Mutation?\"\\n\"No; it\\'s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.\"\\n\"The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.\"\\n\"By all accounts,\" Yueh said. \"They compose poems to their knives. Their\\nwomen are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous.\\nYou\\'ll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay.\"\\nPaul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of\\nwords that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!\\n\"And the worms?\" Paul asked.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I\\'d like to study more about the sandworms.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h-h, to be sure. I\\'ve a filmbook on a small specimen, only one hundred\\nand ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the\\nnorthern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been\\nrecorded by reliable witnesses, and there\\'s reason to believe even larger ones\\nexist.\"\\nPaul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen\\nlatitudes spread on the table. \"The desert belt and south polar regions are\\nmarked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?\"\\n\"And the storms.\"\\n\"But any place can be made habitable.\"\\n\"If it\\'s economically feasible,\" Yueh said. \"Arrakis has many costly\\nperils.\" He smoothed his drooping mustache. \"Your father will be here soon.\\nBefore I go, I\\'ve a gift for you, something I came across in packing.\" He put an\\nobject on the table between them -- black, oblong, no larger than the end of\\nPaul\\'s thumb.\\nPaul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought:\\nHow cautious he is.\\n\"It\\'s a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a\\nfilmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and\\nelectrostatic charge system.\" He picked it up, demonstrated. \"The book is held\\nclosed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the\\nedge -- thus, and the pages you\\'ve selected repel each other and the book\\nopens.\"\\n\"It\\'s so small.\"\\n\"But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge -- thus, and so . . .\\nand the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the\\nactual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.\" He closed\\nthe book, handed it to Paul. \"Try it.\"\\n\\n\\x0cYueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: I salve my own\\nconscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may I\\nsay to myself that he has gone where I cannot go.\\n\"This must\\'ve been made before filmbooks,\" Paul said.\\n\"It\\'s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too\\nvaluable for one so young.\"\\nAnd Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.\\n\"Well . . . \" Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. \"If it\\'s so\\nvaluable . . . \"\\n\"Indulge an old man\\'s whim,\" Yueh said. \"It was given to me when I was very\\nyoung.\" And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. \"Open it\\nto four-sixty-seven Kalima -- where it says: \\'From water does all life begin.\\'\\nThere\\'s a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place.\"\\nPaul felt the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other. He\\npressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier\\nsliding into place.\\n\"Read it aloud,\" Yueh said.\\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, read: \"Think you of the fact that a deaf\\nperson cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do\\nwe lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is\\nthere around us that we cannot --\"\\n\"Stop it!\" Yueh barked.\\nPaul broke off, stared at him.\\nYueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the\\nbook to open at my Wanna\\'s favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul\\nstaring at him.\\n\"Is something wrong?\" Paul asked.\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" Yueh said. \"That was . . . my . . . dead wife\\'s favorite\\npassage. It\\'s not the one I intended you to read. It brings up memories that are\\n. . . painful.\"\\n\"There are two notches,\" Paul said.\\nOf course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more\\nsensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.\\n\"You may find the book interesting,\" Yueh said. \"It has much historical\\ntruth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.\"\\nPaul looked down at the tiny book in his palm -- such a small thing. Yet, it\\ncontained a mystery . . . something had happened while he read from it. He had\\nfelt something stir his terrible purpose.\\n\"Your father will be here any minute,\" Yueh said. \"Put the book away and\\nread it at your leisure.\"\\nPaul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself.\\nHe slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him,\\nPaul had feared the man would demand the book\\'s return.\\n\"I thank you for the gift. Dr. Yueh,\" Paul said, speaking formally. \"It will\\nbe our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not\\nhesitate to ask.\"\\n\"I . . . need for nothing,\" Yueh said.\\nAnd he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself?

Damn those Harkonnen beasts!\\nWhy did they choose me for their abomination?\\n', 6: '\\nHow do we approach the study of Muad\\'Dib\\'s father? A man of surpassing warmth\\nand surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way\\nto this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held\\nfor his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there -- a man\\n\\n\\x0csnared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his\\nson. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?\\n-from \"Muad\\'Dib, Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan\\nPaul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up\\nstations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a\\nsense of presence in his father, someone totally here.\\nThe Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed\\nonly by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk\\ncrest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded\\nhis narrow waist.\\nThe Duke said: \"Hard at work, Son?\"\\nHe crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze\\naround the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not\\nshowing his fatigue. I must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to\\nArrakis, he thought. There\\'ll be no rest on Arrakis.\\n\"Not very hard,\" Paul said. \"Everything\\'s so . . . \" He shrugged.\\n\"Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It\\'ll be good to get settled in our new home,\\nput all this upset behind.\"\\nPaul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother\\'s words: \" .\\n. . for the father, nothing.\"\\n\"Father,\" Paul said, \"will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?\"\\nThe Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the\\ntable, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind -- the kind\\nof thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The\\npattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought:\\nThis is my son.\\n\"It\\'ll be dangerous,\" he admitted.\\n\"Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,\" Paul said. And he wondered:\\nWhy don\\'t I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?\\nThe Duke noted his son\\'s distress, said: \"As always, Hawat sees the main\\nchance. But there\\'s much more. I see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer\\nMercantiles -- the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to\\ngive us a CHOAM directorship . . . a subtle gain.\"\\n\"CHOAM controls the spice,\" Paul said.\\n\"And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,\" the Duke said.\\n\"There\\'s more to CHOAM than melange.\"\\n\"Did the Reverend Mother warn you?\" Paul blurted. He clenched his fists,\\nfeeling his palms slippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask\\nthat question.\\n\"Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,\" the Duke\\nsaid. \"Don\\'t let a woman\\'s fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones\\nendangered. The hand behind those warnings was your mother\\'s. Take this as a\\nsign of her love for us.\"\\n\"Does she know about the Fremen?\"\\n\"Yes, and about much more.\"\\n\"What?\"\\nAnd the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even\\ndangerous facts are valuable if you\\'ve been trained to deal with them. And\\nthere\\'s one place where nothing has been spared for my son -- dealing with\\ndangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.\\n\"Few products escape the CHOAM touch,\" the Duke said. \"Logs, donkeys,\\nhorses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur -- the most prosaic and the most\\nexotic . . . even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will\\ntransport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades\\nbefore melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be\\n\\n\\x0cmanufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true\\ngeriatric properties.\"\\n\"And now we control it?\"\\n\"To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses\\nthat depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those\\nprofits dependent upon a single product -- the spice. Imagine what would happen\\nif something should reduce spice production.\"\\n\"Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,\" Paul said. \"Others\\nwould be out in the cold.\"\\nThe Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his son\\nand thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been. He\\nnodded. \"The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.\"\\n\"They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.\"\\n\"They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,\" the Duke said. \"Think of\\nthe Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership -- their\\nunofficial spokesman. Think how they\\'d react if I were responsible for a serious\\nreduction in their income. After all, one\\'s own profits come first. The Great\\nConvention be damned! You can\\'t let someone pauperize you!\" A harsh smile\\ntwisted the Duke\\'s mouth. \"They\\'d look the other way no matter what was done to\\nme.\"\\n\"Even if we were attacked with atomics?\"\\n\"Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost\\nanything else short of that . . . perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil\\npoisoning.\"\\n\"Then why are we walking into this?\"\\n\"Paul!\" The Duke frowned at his son. \"Knowing where the trap is -- that\\'s\\nthe first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger\\nscale -- a feint within a feint within a feint . . . seemingly without end. The\\ntask is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask\\nanother question: Who else is stockpiling? That\\'s the list of our enemies.\"\\n\"Who?\"\\n\"Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we\\'d thought friendly. We\\nneed not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more\\nimportant: our beloved Padishah Emperor.\"\\nPaul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. \"Couldn\\'t you convene the\\nLandsraad, expose --\"\\n\"Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul -we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If we put this\\nbefore the Landsraad it\\'d only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor\\nwould deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we\\'d gain is a little time while\\nrisking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?\"\\n\"All the Houses might start stockpiling spice.\"\\n\"Our enemies have a head start -- too much of a lead to overcome.\"\\n\"The Emperor,\" Paul said. \"That means the Sardaukar.\"\\n\"Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,\" the Duke said. \"But the soldier\\nfanatics nonetheless.\"\\n\"How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?\"\\n\"Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?\"\\n\"The Emperor\\'s prison planet? No.\"\\n\"What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There\\'s a question you\\nnever hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come\\nfrom?\"\\n\"From the prison planet?\"\\n\"They come from somewhere.\"\\n\"But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from --\"\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'re led to believe: they\\'re just the Emperor\\'s levies trained\\nyoung and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor\\'s\\n\\n\\x0ctraining cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the\\nmilitary forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and\\ntheir supporting levies on the other. And their supporting levies, Paul. The\\nSardaukar remain the Sardaukar.\"\\n\"But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!\"\\n\"Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men,\\nwhat environmental conditions would you impose on them?\"\\n\"How could you win the loyalty of such men?\"\\n\"There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority,\\nthe mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done.\\nIt has been done on many worlds in many times.\"\\nPaul nodded, holding his attention on his father\\'s face. He felt some\\nrevelation impending.\\n\"Consider Arrakis,\" the Duke said. \"When you get outside the towns and\\ngarrison villages, it\\'s every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus.\"\\nPaul\\'s eyes went wide. \"The Fremen!\"\\n\"We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the\\nSardaukar. It\\'ll require patience to exploit them secretly and wealth to equip\\nthem properly. But the Fremen are there . . . and the spice wealth is there. You\\nsee now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.\"\\n\"Don\\'t the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?\"\\n\"The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even\\nbothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary\\npopulations -- spend as little as possible to maintain them.\"\\nThe metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father\\'s breast glistened\\nas the Duke shifted his position. \"You see?\"\\n\"We\\'re negotiating with the Fremen right now,\" Paul said.\\n\"I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,\" the Duke said. \"A proud and\\nruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. I think the Fremen will admire him.\\nIf we\\'re lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.\"\\n\"Duncan, the moral,\" Paul said, \"and Gurney the valorous.\"\\n\"You name them well,\" the Duke said.\\nAnd Paul thought: Gurney\\'s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a\\nsupporter of worlds -- \" . . . the valor of the brave.\"\\n\"Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,\" the Duke said.\\n\"That isn\\'t what he told me.\"\\nThe Duke laughed aloud. \"I figured Gurney to be sparse with his praise. He\\nsays you have a nicety of awareness -- in his own words -- of the difference\\nbetween a blade\\'s edge and its tip.\"\\n\"Gurney says there\\'s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be\\ndone with the edge.\"\\n\"Gurney\\'s a romantic,\" the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly\\ndisturbed him, coming from his son. \"I\\'d sooner you never had to kill . . . but\\nif the need arises, you do it however you can -- tip or edge.\" He looked up at\\nthe skylight, on which the rain was drumming.\\nSeeing the direction of his father\\'s stare, Paul thought of the wet skies\\nout there -- a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts -- and this\\nthought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. \"Are the Guild ships\\nreally big?\" he asked.\\nThe Duke looked at him. \"This will be your first time off planet,\" he said.\\n\"Yes, they\\'re big. We\\'ll be riding a Heighliner because it\\'s a long trip. A\\nHeighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into\\na little corner -- we\\'ll be just a small part of the ship\\'s manifest.\"\\n\"And we won\\'t be able to leave our frigates?\"\\n\"That\\'s part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be\\nHarkonnen ships right alongside us and we\\'d have nothing to fear from them. The\\nHarkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"I\\'m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.\"\\n\"You won\\'t. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild\\'s as\\njealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly. Don\\'t do anything to endanger\\nour shipping privileges, Paul.\"\\n\"Do you think they hide because they\\'ve mutated and don\\'t look . . . human\\nanymore?\"\\n\"Who knows?\" The Duke shrugged. \"It\\'s a mystery we\\'re not likely to solve.\\nWe\\'ve more immediate problems -- among them: you.\"\\n\"Me?\"\\n\"Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have\\nMentat capabilities.\"\\nPaul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: \"A Mentat?\\nMe? But I . . . \"\\n\"Hawat agrees, Son. It\\'s true.\"\\n\"But I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject\\ncouldn\\'t be told because it might inhibit the early . . . \" He broke off, all\\nhis past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. \"I see,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\"A day comes,\" the Duke said, \"when the potential Mentat must learn what\\'s\\nbeing done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the\\nchoice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some\\nare incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about\\nhimself.\"\\nPaul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother -the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of\\nsensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices -- all of it clicked\\ninto a new kind of understanding in his mind.\\n\"You\\'ll be the Duke someday, Son,\" his father said. \"A Mentat Duke would be\\nformidable indeed. Can you decide now . . . or do you need more time?\"\\nThere was no hesitation in his answer. \"I\\'ll go on with the training.\"\\n\"Formidable indeed,\" the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his\\nfather\\'s face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke\\'s narrow\\nfeatures. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within\\nhim. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he thought.\\nBut even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.\\n', 7: '\\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom\\nof seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G.\\npersonnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends\\nhad taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend\\nMother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And\\nit is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica\\'s latent abilities were\\ngrossly underestimated.\\n-from \"Analysis: The Arrakeen Crisis\" by the Princess Irulan [Private\\ncirculation: B.G. file number AR-81088587]\\nAll around the Lady Jessica -- piled in corners of the Arrakeen great hall,\\nmounded in the open spaces -- stood the packaged freight of their lives: boxes,\\ntrunks, cartons, cases -- some partly unpacked. She could hear the cargo\\nhandlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.\\nJessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a slow turn, looking\\nup and around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This\\ngiant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters\\' Hall at her Bene\\n\\n\\x0cGesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was\\nbleak stone.\\nSome architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls\\nand dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her\\nwith great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across\\nspace at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams\\n-- unless the beams were imitation wood.\\nShe thought not.\\nThis had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs\\nhad been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their\\nnew megalopolis of Carthag -- a cheap and brassy place some two hundred\\nkilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this\\nplace for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled\\nwith tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.\\nAgain there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica\\nsighed.\\nAgainst a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke\\'s father.\\nWrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was\\nstill clutched in Jessica\\'s left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull\\'s\\nhead mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded\\npaper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull\\'s shiny muzzle pointed at\\nthe ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this\\nechoing room.\\nJessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things\\nfirst -- the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the\\naction. Not since the day when the Duke\\'s buyers had taken her from the school\\nhad she felt this frightened and unsure of herself.\\nThe head and the picture.\\nThey heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the\\nslit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these\\nlatitudes the sky looked black and cold -- so much darker than the warm blue of\\nCaladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.\\nSo far away, Caladan.\\n\"Here we are!\"\\nThe voice was Duke Leto\\'s.\\nShe whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall.\\nHis black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked\\ndusty and rumpled.\\n\"I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,\" he said.\\n\"It is a cold house,\" she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin\\nthat made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was\\nwoodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of\\nsharp angles and planes.\\nA sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage,\\ndriving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor\\'s command.\\n\"The whole city feels cold,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s a dirty, dusty little garrison town,\" he agreed. \"But we\\'ll change\\nthat.\" He looked around the hall. \"These are public rooms for state occasions.\\nI\\'ve just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They\\'re\\nmuch nicer.\" He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.\\nAnd again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry -- a renegade House, perhaps?\\nSome black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor\\'s own blood.\\nUnder the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile.\\nAnd he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to\\nfocus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her\\neyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose\\n\\n\\x0cwas small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and\\nwith its curves gone to slimness.\\nHe remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so\\nhis buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a\\nregal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her.\\n\"Where\\'s Paul?\" he asked.\\n\"Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.\"\\n\"Probably in the south wing,\" he said. \"I thought I heard Yueh\\'s voice, but\\nI couldn\\'t take time to look.\" He glanced down at her, hesitating. \"I came here\\nonly to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.\"\\nShe caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the\\nkey -- there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for\\ncomforting. \"I saw our banner over the house as we came in,\" she said.\\nHe glanced at the painting of his father. \"Where were you going to hang\\nthat?\"\\n\"Somewhere in here.\"\\n\"No.\" The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to\\npersuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the\\ngesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.\\n\"My Lord,\" she said, \"if you\\'d only . . . \"\\n\"The answer remains no. I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in\\nthis. I\\'ve just come from the dining hall where there are --\"\\n\"My Lord! Please.\"\\n\"The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear,\" he\\nsaid. \"They will hang in the dining hall.\"\\nShe sighed. \"Yes, my Lord.\"\\n\"You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. I\\nshall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.\"\\n\"Thank you, my Lord.\"\\n\"And don\\'t go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that I never married\\nyou, my dear. Then it\\'d be your duty to join me at table for every meal.\"\\nShe held her face immobile, nodded.\\n\"Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,\" he said.\\n\"There\\'s a portable in your room.\"\\n\"You anticipated this . . . disagreement,\" she said.\\n\"My dear, I think also of your comfort. I\\'ve engaged servants. They\\'re\\nlocals, but Hawat has cleared them -- they\\'re Fremen all. They\\'ll do until our\\nown people can be released from their other duties.\"\\n\"Can anyone from this place be truly safe?\"\\n\"Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head\\nhousekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.\"\\n\"Shadout,\" Jessica said. \"A Fremen title?\"\\n\"I\\'m told it means \\'well-dipper,\\' a meaning with rather important overtones\\nhere. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of\\nher on the basis of Duncan\\'s report. They\\'re convinced she wants to serve -specifically that she wants to serve you.\"\\n\"Me?\"\\n\"The Fremen have learned that you\\'re Bene Gesserit,\" he said. \"There are\\nlegends here about the Bene Gesserit.\"\\nThe Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.\\n\"Does this mean Duncan was successful?\" she asked. \"Will the Fremen be our\\nallies?\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing definite,\" he said. \"They wish to observe us for a while,\\nDuncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying\\nvillages during a truce period. That\\'s a more important gain than it might seem.\\nHawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the\\n\\n\\x0cextent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It wouldn\\'t have helped\\nfor the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.\"\\n\"A Fremen housekeeper,\" Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the\\nShadout Mapes. \"She\\'ll have the all-blue eyes.\"\\n\"Don\\'t let the appearance of these people deceive you,\" he said. \"There\\'s a\\ndeep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they\\'ll be everything we\\nneed.\"\\n\"It\\'s a dangerous gamble,\" she said.\\n\"Let\\'s not go into that again,\" he said.\\nShe forced a smile. \"We are committed, no doubt of that.\" She went through\\nthe quick regimen of calmness -- the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then:\\n\"When I assign rooms, is there anything special I should reserve for you?\"\\n\"You must teach me someday how you do that,\" he said, \"the way you thrust\\nyour worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit\\nthing.\"\\n\"It\\'s a female thing,\" she said.\\nHe smiled. \"Well, assignment of rooms: make certain, I have large office\\nspace next my sleeping quarters. There\\'ll be more paper work here than on\\nCaladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don\\'t worry about\\nsecurity of the house. Hawat\\'s men have been over it in depth.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure they have.\"\\nHe glanced at his wristwatch. \"And you might see that all our timepieces are\\nadjusted for Arrakeen local. I\\'ve assigned a tech to take care of it. He\\'ll be\\nalong presently.\" He brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead. \"I\\nmust return to the landing field now. The second shuttle\\'s due any minute with\\nmy staff reserves.\"\\n\"Couldn\\'t Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.\"\\n\"The good Thufir is even busier than I am. You know this planet\\'s infested\\nwith Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, I must try persuading some of the trained\\nspice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change\\nof fief -- and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as\\nJudge of the Change cannot be bought. He\\'s allowing the opt. About eight hundred\\ntrained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there\\'s a Guild cargo\\nship standing by.\"\\n\"My Lord . . . \" She broke off, hesitating.\\n\"Yes?\"\\nHe will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us,\\nshe thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.\\n\"At what time will you be expecting dinner?\" she asked.\\nThat\\'s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica,\\nwould that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place -alone, the two of us, without a care.\\n\"I\\'ll eat in the officers\\' mess at the field,\" he said. \"Don\\'t expect me\\nuntil very late. And . . .ah, I\\'ll be sending a guardcar for Paul. I want him to\\nattend our strategy conference.\"\\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without\\nwarning, turned and strode out, headed for the entry where she could hear more\\nboxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and\\ndisdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: \"The\\nLady Jessica\\'s in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately.\"\\nThe outer door slammed.\\nJessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto\\'s father. It had been done\\nby the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke\\'s middle years. He was portrayed\\nin matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked\\nyoung, hardly older than Leto\\'s now, and with the same hawk features, the same\\ngray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting.\\n\"Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!\" she whispered.\\n\\n\\x0c\"What are your orders, Noble Born?\"\\nIt was a woman\\'s voice, thin and stringy.\\nJessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a shapeless\\nsack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any\\nmember of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field\\nthat morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked\\nprune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And\\nthere were the eyes, of course -- that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any\\nwhite -- secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.\\nThe woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: \"I am called the Shadout Mapes,\\nNoble Born. What are your orders?\"\\n\"You may refer to me as \\'my Lady,\\' \" Jessica said. \"I\\'m not noble born. I\\'m\\nthe bound concubine of the Duke Leto.\"\\nAgain that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly\\nquestioning, \"There\\'s a wife, then?\"\\n\"There is not, nor has there ever been. I am the Duke\\'s only . . .\\ncompanion, the mother of his heir-designate.\"\\nEven as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words.\\nWhat was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. \"The mind commands the body\\nand it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.\" Yes -- I am meeting\\nmore resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.\\nA weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: \"Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo-Sook!\" Then: \"Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!\" And again: \"Soo-sooSook!\"\\n\"What is that?\" Jessica asked. \"I heard it several times as we drove through\\nthe streets this morning.\"\\n\"Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you\\'ve no need to interest yourself in\\nsuch as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it\\'s always kept\\nfull.\" She glanced down at her dress. \"Why, you know, my Lady, I don\\'t even have\\nto wear my stillsuit here?\" She cackled. \"And me not even dead!\"\\nJessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to\\nguide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more\\nimperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark\\nof wealth here.\\n\"My husband told me of your title, Shadout,\" Jessica said. \"I recognized the\\nword. It\\'s a very ancient word.\"\\n\"You know the ancient tongues then?\" Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd\\nintensity.\\n\"Tongues are the Bene Gesserit\\'s first learning,\" Jessica said. \"I know the\\nBhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.\"\\nMapes nodded. \"Just as the legend says.\"\\nAnd Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit\\nways were devious and compelling.\\n\"I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,\" Jessica said. She\\nread the more obvious signs in Mapes\\' actions and appearance, the petit\\nbetrayals. \"Miseces prejia,\" she said in the Chakobsa tongue. \"Andral t\\'re pera!\\nTrada cik buscakri miseces perakri --\"\\nMapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.\\n\"I know many things.\" Jessica said. \"I know that you have borne children,\\nthat you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have\\ndone violence and will yet do more violence. I know many things.\"\\nIn a low voice, Mapes said: \"I meant no offense, my Lady.\"\\n\"You speak of the legend and seek answers,\" Jessica said. \"Beware the\\nanswers you may find. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in\\nyour bodice.\"\\n\"My Lady, I . . . \"\\n\\n\\x0c\"There\\'s a remote possibility you could draw my life\\'s blood,\" Jessica said,\\n\"but in so doing you\\'d bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could\\nimagine. There are worse things than dying, you know -- even for an entire\\npeople.\"\\n\"My Lady!\" Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. \"The\\nweapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.\"\\n\"And as the means of my death should I prove otherwise,\" Jessica said. She\\nwaited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so\\nterrifying in combat.\\nNow we see which way the decision tips, she thought.\\nSlowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath.\\nA black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one\\nhand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white blade, held it up. The blade\\nseemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was double-edged like a\\nkindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long.\\n\"Do you know this, my Lady?\" Mapes asked.\\nIt could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis,\\nthe blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor\\nand wild gossip.\\n\"It\\'s a crysknife,\" she said.\\n\"Say it not lightly,\" Mapes said. \"Do you know its meaning?\"\\nAnd Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here\\'s the reason\\nthis Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could\\nprecipitate violence or . . . what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of\\na knife. She\\'s called the Shadow in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that\\'s \"Death\\nMaker\" in Chakobsa. She\\'s getting restive. I must answer now. Delay is as\\ndangerous as the wrong answer.\\nJessica said: \"It\\'s a maker --\"\\n\"Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!\" Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation.\\nShe trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection\\nshooting around the room.\\nJessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of\\ndeath and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the\\ndeep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle\\ntwitch.\\nThe key word was . . . maker.\\nMaker? Maker.\\nStill, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.\\nJessica said: \"Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great\\nMother, would not know the Maker?\"\\nMapes lowered the knife. \"My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so\\nlong, the moment of revelation is a shock.\"\\nJessica thought about the prophecy -- the Shari-a and all the panoplia\\npropheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long\\ncenturies ago -- long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the\\nprotective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene\\nGesserit\\'s need.\\nWell, that day had come.\\nMapes returned knife to sheath, said: \"This is an unfixed blade, my Lady.\\nKeep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to\\ndisintegrate. It\\'s yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live.\"\\nJessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: \"Mapes, you\\'ve sheathed\\nthat blade unblooded.\"\\nWith a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica\\'s hand, tore open\\nthe brown bodice, wailing: \"Take the water of my life!\"\\nJessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed\\nthe point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman.\\n\\n\\x0cPoison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew a delicate\\nscratch with the blade\\'s edge above Mapes\\' left breast. There was a thick\\nwelling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica\\nthought. A moisture-conserving mutation?\\nShe sheathed the blade, said: \"Button your dress, Mapes.\"\\nMapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica. \"You are\\nours,\" she muttered. \"You are the One.\"\\nThere came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed\\nthe sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica\\'s bodice. \"Who sees that knife must\\nbe cleansed or slain!\" she snarled. \"You know that, my Lady!\"\\nI know it now, Jessica thought.\\nThe cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.\\nMapes composed herself, said: \"The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may\\nnot leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You\\'ve been entrusted with\\na crysknife.\" She took a deep breath. \"Now the thing must take its course. It\\ncannot be hurried.\" She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around\\nthem. \"And there\\'s work aplenty to while the time for us here.\"\\nJessica hesitated. \"The thing must take its course.\" That was a specific\\ncatchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva\\'s stock of incantations -- The\\ncoming of the Reverend Mother to free you.\\nBut I\\'m not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They\\nplanted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: \"What\\'ll you be wanting me to do first,\\nmy Lady?\"\\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: \"The painting\\nof the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The\\nbull\\'s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.\"\\nMapes crossed to the bull\\'s head. \"What a great beast it must have been to\\ncarry such a head,\" she said. She stooped. \"I\\'ll have to be cleaning this first,\\nwon\\'t I, my Lady?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"But there\\'s dirt caked on its horns.\"\\n\"That\\'s not dirt, Mapes. That\\'s the blood of our Duke\\'s father. Those horns\\nwere sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed\\nthe Old Duke.\"\\nMapes stood up. \"Ah, now!\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s just blood,\" Jessica said. \"Old blood at that. Get some help hanging\\nthese now. The beastly things are heavy.\"\\n\"Did you think the blood bothered me?\" Mapes asked. \"I\\'m of the desert and\\nI\\'ve seen blood aplenty.\"\\n\"I . . . see that you have,\" Jessica said.\\n\"And some of it my own,\" Mapes said. \"More\\'n you drew with your puny\\nscratch.\"\\n\"You\\'d rather I\\'d cut deeper?\"\\n\"Ah, no! The body\\'s water is scant enough \\'thout gushing a wasteful lot of\\nit into the air. You did the thing right.\"\\nAnd Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in\\nthe phrase, \\'the body\\'s water.\\' Again she felt a sense of oppression at the\\nimportance of water on Arrakis.\\n\"On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties,\\nmy Lady?\" Mapes asked.\\nEver the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: \"Use your own\\njudgment, Mapes. It makes no real difference.\"\\n\"As you say, my Lady.\" Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine\\nfrom the head. \"Killed an old duke, did you?\" she crooned.\\n\"Shall I summon a handler to help you?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"I\\'ll manage, my Lady.\"\\n\\n\\x0cYes, she\\'ll manage, Jessica thought. There\\'s that about this Fremen\\ncreature: the drive to manage.\\nJessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of\\nthe long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here.\\nBecause of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. \"It cannot be\\nhurried,\" Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this\\nplace that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the\\nMissionaria Protectiva nor Hawat\\'s suspicious inspection of this castellated\\npile of rocks could dispel the feeling.\\n\"When you\\'ve finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes,\" Jessica\\nsaid. \"One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things\\nshould go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any questions I\\'ll\\nbe in the south wing.\"\\n\"As you will, my Lady,\" Mapes said.\\nJessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe,\\nbut there\\'s something wrong about the place. I can feel it.\\nAn urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward the\\narched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family\\nwings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.\\nBehind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull\\'s head,\\nlooked at the retreating back. \"She\\'s the One all right,\" she muttered. \"Poor\\nthing.\"\\n', 8: '\\n\"Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!\" goes the refrain. \"A million deaths were not enough for\\nYueh!\"\\n-from \"A Child\\'s History of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it into a room with yellow\\nwalls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases,\\na hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right, bracketing\\nanother door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs.\\nAt the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his back to her, his\\nattention fixed upon the outside world.\\nJessica took another silent step into the room.\\nShe saw that Yueh\\'s coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left elbow as\\nthough he had leaned against chalk. He looked, from behind, like a fleshless\\nstick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy\\nmovement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block of head\\nwith long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the shoulder seemed\\nalive--turning slightly to follow some movement outside.\\nAgain, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the\\nclosed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had\\nexpressed a liking.\\n\"Good afternoon. Dr. Yueh,\" she said. \"Where\\'s Paul?\"\\nHe nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner\\nwithout turning: \"Your son grew tired, Jessica. I sent him into the next room to\\nrest.\"\\nAbruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled\\nlips. \"Forgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away . . . I . . . did not mean\\nto be familiar.\"\\nShe smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might\\nkneel. \"Wellington, please.\"\\n\"To use your name like that . . . I . . . \"\\n\"We\\'ve known each other six years,\" she said. \"It\\'s long past time\\nformalities should\\'ve been dropped between us--in private.\"\\n\\n\\x0cYueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: I believe it has worked. Now, she\\'ll\\nthink anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She\\'ll not look for\\ndeeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.\\n\"I\\'m afraid I was woolgathering,\" he said. \"Whenever I . . . feel especially\\nsorry for you. I\\'m afraid I think of you as . . . well, Jessica.\"\\n\"Sorry for me? Whatever for?\"\\nYueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the\\nfull Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with\\nJessica whenever possible. It was safest.\\n\"You\\'ve seen this place, my . . . Jessica.\" He stumbled over the name,\\nplunged ahead: \"So barren after Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we\\npassed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us.\"\\nShe folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the\\ncrysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm\\'s tooth, if the reports were\\nright. \"It\\'s just that we\\'re strange to them--different people, different\\ncustoms. They\\'ve known only the Harkonnens.\" She looked past him out the\\nwindows. \"What were you staring at out there?\"\\nHe turned back to the window. \"The people.\"\\nJessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the\\nhouse where Yueh\\'s attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew\\nthere, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated\\nthem from the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a\\nfaint shimmering in the air between her and the people--a house shield--and went\\non to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.\\nThe pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing\\npeople looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate . . . even a sense of\\nhope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.\\n\"Do you know what they\\'re thinking?\" Yueh asked.\\n\"You profess to read minds?\" she asked.\\n\"Those minds,\" he said. \"They look at those trees and they think; \\'There are\\none hundred of us.\\' That\\'s what they think.\"\\nShe turned a puzzled frown on him. \"Why?\"\\n\"Those are date palms,\" he said. \"One date palm requires forty liters of\\nwater a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men.\\nThere are twenty palms out there--one hundred men.\"\\n\"But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.\"\\n\"They but hope some dates will fall, except it\\'s the wrong season.\"\\n\"We look at this place with too critical an eye,\" she said. \"There\\'s hope as\\nwell as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can\\nmake this world into whatever we wish.\"\\nAnd she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The laugh\\nbroke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. \"But you can\\'t\\nbuy security,\" she said.\\nYueh turned away to hide his face from her. If only it were possible to hate\\nthese people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like\\nhis Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his\\npurpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be\\ndead. He had to be certain.\\n\"Do not worry for us, Wellington,\" Jessica said. \"The problem\\'s ours, not\\nyours.\"\\nShe thinks I worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But\\nI must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one\\nchance to strike him where he is weakest--in his gloating moment!\\nHe sighed.\\n\"Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?\" she asked.\\n\"Not at all. I gave him a sedative.\"\\n\"He\\'s taking the change well?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Except for getting a bit overtired. He\\'s excited, but what fifteen-year-old\\nwouldn\\'t be under these circumstances?\" He crossed to the door, opened it. \"He\\'s\\nin here.\"\\nJessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.\\nPaul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown\\nback over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of\\nshadows across face and blanket.\\nJessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own.\\nBut the hair was the Duke\\'s--coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed the\\nlime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was suddenly\\ncaught by the idea of genetic traces in her son\\'s features--her lines in eyes\\nand facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline\\nlike maturity emerging from childhood.\\nShe thought of the boy\\'s features as an exquisite distillation out of random\\npatterns--endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought made\\nher want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was\\ninhibited by Yueh\\'s presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.\\nYueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica\\nstared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. I\\nknow as a doctor there was no physical reason against it. Was there some Bene\\nGesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose? What\\ncould it have been? She loved me, certainly.\\nFor the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of\\na pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.\\nJessica stopped beside him, said: \"What delicious abandon in the sleep of a\\nchild.\"\\nHe spoke mechanically: \"If only adults could relax like that.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Where do we lose it?\" he murmured.\\nShe glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul,\\nthinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in\\nhis life now--so very different from the life they once had planned for him.\\n\"We do, indeed, lose something,\" she said.\\nShe glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled gray-green of bushes--dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung over\\nthe slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a\\nsilver cast--light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.\\n\"The sky\\'s so dark,\" she said.\\n\"That\\'s partly the lack of moisture,\" he said.\\n\"Water!\" she snapped. \"Everywhere you turn here, you\\'re involved with the\\nlack of water!\"\\n\"It\\'s the precious mystery of Arrakis,\" he said.\\n\"Why is there so little of it? There\\'s volcanic rock here. There\\'re a dozen\\npower sources I could name. There\\'s polar ice. They say you can\\'t drill in the\\ndesert--storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed,\\nif the worms don\\'t get you first. They\\'ve never found water traces there,\\nanyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that\\'ve been\\ndrilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?\"\\n\"First a trickle, then nothing,\" he said.\\n\"But, Wellington, that\\'s the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And\\nnever again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a\\ntrickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?\"\\n\"It is curious,\" he said. \"You suspect some living agency? Wouldn\\'t that\\nhave shown in core samples?\"\\n\"What would have shown? Alien plant matter . . . or animal? Who could\\nrecognize it?\" She turned back to the slope. \"The water is stopped. Something\\nplugs it. That\\'s my suspicion.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Perhaps the reason\\'s known,\" he said. \"The Harkonnens sealed off many\\nsources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress\\nthis.\"\\n\"What reason?\" she asked. \"And then there\\'s the atmospheric moisture. Little\\nenough of it, certainly, but there\\'s some. It\\'s the major source of water here,\\ncaught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?\"\\n\"The polar caps?\"\\n\"Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind\\nthe Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of those things\\nare directly involved with the spice.\"\\n\"We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,\" he said. \"Perhaps we\\'ll . . . \"\\nHe broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. \"Is\\nsomething wrong?\"\\n\"The way you say \\'Harkonnen,\\' \" she said. \"Even my Duke\\'s voice doesn\\'t\\ncarry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. I didn\\'t know you had\\npersonal reasons to hate them, Wellington.\"\\nGreat Mother! he thought. I\\'ve aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every\\ntrick my Wanna taught me. There\\'s only one solution: tell the truth as far as I\\ncan.\\nHe said: \"You didn\\'t know that my wife, my Wanna . . . \" He shrugged, unable\\nto speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: \"They . . . \" The words\\nwould not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the\\nagony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.\\n\"Forgive me,\" Jessica said. \"I did not mean to open an old wound.\" And she\\nthought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit--the signs are all over him.\\nAnd it\\'s obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here\\'s another poor victim bound to\\nthe Atreides by a cherem of hate.\\n\"I am sorry,\" he said. \"I\\'m unable to talk about it.\" He opened his eyes,\\ngiving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.\\nJessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond\\neyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a curved frame\\naround purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she\\nsaw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over\\nher.\\n\"Wellington, I\\'m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,\" she said.\\n\"I came willingly,\" he said. And that, too, was true.\\n\"But this whole planet\\'s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.\"\\n\"It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,\" he said. And that,\\ntoo, was true.\\n\"Perhaps I should be more confident of him,\" she said. \"He is a brilliant\\ntactician.\"\\n\"We\\'ve been uprooted,\" he said. \"That\\'s why we\\'re uneasy.\"\\n\"And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant,\" she said. \"Especially when\\nyou put it down in hostile soil.\"\\n\"Are we certain the soil\\'s hostile?\"\\n\"There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was\\nadding to the population,\" she said. \"They stopped only when the people learned\\nwe were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.\"\\n\"There is only so much water to support human life here,\" he said. \"The\\npeople know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up\\nand the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn\\'t follow that the\\nriots mean permanent hostility toward him.\"\\n\"And guards,\" she said. \"Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the\\nblurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.\"\\n\"Give this planet a chance,\" he said.\\nBut Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. \"I can smell death\\nin this place,\" she said. \"Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion.\\n\\n\\x0cThose guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There\\'ve been\\nunexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only\\none thing: bribes in high places.\" She shook her head. \"Where Thufir Hawat goes,\\ndeath and deceit follow.\"\\n\"You malign him.\"\\n\"Malign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just do\\nnot fool myself about Thufir\\'s methods.\"\\n\"You should . . . keep busy,\" he said. \"Give yourself no time for such\\nmorbid--\"\\n\"Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? I am the Duke\\'s\\nsecretary--so busy that each day I learn new things to fear . . . things even he\\ndoesn\\'t suspect I know.\" She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: \"Sometimes I\\nwonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.\"\\n\"What do you mean?\" He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the\\nbitterness that he had never seen her expose.\\n\"Don\\'t you think, Wellington,\" she asked, \"that a secretary bound to one by\\nlove is so much safer?\"\\n\"That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.\"\\nThe rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt\\nabout his concubine. One had only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.\\nShe sighed. \"You\\'re right. It\\'s not worthy.\"\\nAgain, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh\\nand thinking of the unfinished business it represented.\\n\"There\\'ll be much bloodshed soon,\" she said. \"The Harkonnens won\\'t rest\\nuntil they\\'re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a\\ncousin of the royal blood--no matter what the distance--while the Harkonnen\\ntitles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his\\nmind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice\\nafter, the Battle of Corrin.\"\\n\"The old feud,\" Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of\\nhate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or--worse--left\\nher for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had\\ntrapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was\\nthat such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in\\nthe universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.\\n\"What are you thinking?\" she asked.\\n\"I am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand Solaris\\nthe decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things.\"\\n\"Does greed touch even you, Wellington?\"\\n\"Not greed.\"\\n\"What then?\"\\nHe shrugged. \"Futility.\" He glanced at her. \"Can you remember your first\\ntaste of spice?\"\\n\"It tasted like cinnamon.\"\\n\"But never twice the same,\" he said. \"It\\'s like life--it presents a\\ndifferent face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a\\nlearned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets\\nthe flavor as pleasurable--slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly\\nsynthesized.\"\\n\"I think it would\\'ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves\\nbeyond the Imperial reach,\" she said.\\nHe saw that she hadn\\'t been listening to him, focused on her words,\\nwondering: Yes--why didn\\'t she make him do this? She could make him do virtually\\nanything.\\nHe spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: \"Would you\\nthink it bold of me . . . Jessica, if I asked a personal question?\"\\n\\n\\x0cShe pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet.\\n\"Of course not. You\\'re . . . my friend.\"\\n\"Why haven\\'t you made the Duke marry you?\"\\nShe whirled, head up, glaring. \"Made him marry me? But--\"\\n\"I should not have asked,\" he said.\\n\"No.\" She shrugged. \"There\\'s good political reason--as long as my Duke\\nremains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And . .\\n. \" She sighed. \" . . . motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you\\na cynical attitude toward humanity. It degrades everything it touches. If I made\\nhim do . . . this, then it would not be his doing.\"\\n\"It\\'s a thing my Wanna might have said,\" he murmured. And this, too, was\\ntruth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been\\ncloser to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. \"Besides, Wellington, the Duke is\\nreally two men. One of them I love very much. He\\'s charming, witty, considerate\\n. . . tender--everything a woman could desire. But the other man is . . . cold,\\ncallous, demanding, selfish--as harsh and cruel as a winter wind. That\\'s the man\\nshaped by the father.\" Her face contorted. \"If only that old man had died when\\nmy Duke was born!\"\\nIn the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be\\nheard fingering the blinds.\\nPresently, she took a deep breath, said, \"Leto\\'s right--these rooms are\\nnicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.\" She turned, sweeping\\nthe room with her gaze. \"If you\\'ll excuse me, Wellington, I want another look\\nthrough this wing before I assign quarters.\"\\nHe nodded. \"Of course.\" And he thought: if only there were some way not to\\ndo this thing that I must do.\\nJessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment,\\nhesitating, then let herself out. All the time we talked he was hiding\\nsomething, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no doubt.\\nHe\\'s a good man. Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh and\\ndrag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to\\nlearn he\\'s so easily read. I should place more trust in my friends.\\n', 9: '\\nMany have marked the speed with which Muad\\'Dib learned the necessities of\\nArrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the\\nothers, we can say that Muad\\'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was\\nin how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could\\nlearn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and\\nhow many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad\\'Dib knew that every\\nexperience carries its lesson.\\n-from \"The Humanity of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nPaul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh\\'s\\nsleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his\\nmother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission\\nto go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn\\'t approve. Things were\\ntoo unsettled yet. No. This way was best.\\nIf I slip out without asking I haven\\'t disobeyed orders. And I will stay in\\nthe house where it\\'s safe.\\nHe heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were\\nindistinct--something about the spice . . . the Harkonnens. The conversation\\nrose and fell.\\nPaul\\'s attention went to the carved headboard of his bed--a false headboard\\nattached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room\\'s functions. A\\n\\n\\x0cleaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He\\nknew if he pushed the fish\\'s one visible eye that would turn on the room\\'s\\nsuspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another\\nchanged the temperature.\\nQuietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his\\nleft. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side.\\nThe handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.\\nIt was as though the room had been designed to entice him.\\nThe room and this planet.\\nHe thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him--\"Arrakis: His Imperial\\nMajesty\\'s Desert Botanical Testing Station.\" It was an old filmbook from before\\ndiscovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul\\'s mind, each with its picture\\nimprinted by the book\\'s mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand\\nverbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote\\nbush . . . kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse . . .\\nNames and pictures, names and pictures from man\\'s terranic past--and many to\\nbe found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.\\nSo many new things to learn about--the spice.\\nAnd the sandworms.\\nA door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother\\'s footsteps\\nretreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and\\nremain in the other room.\\nNow was the moment to go exploring.\\nPaul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into\\nthe closet. He stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of\\nthe bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze,\\nand immobility saved his life.\\nFrom behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five\\ncentimeters long. Paul recognized it at once--a common assassination weapon that\\nevery child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening\\nsliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye. It could burrow into moving\\nflesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.\\nThe seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.\\nThrough Paul\\'s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker\\nlimitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the vision of its\\ntransmitter eye. With nothing but the dim light of the room to reflect his\\ntarget, the operator would be relying on motion--anything that moved. A shield\\ncould slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield\\non the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and\\nnotoriously cranky of maintenance--and there was always the peril of explosive\\npyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on\\ntheir body shields and their wits.\\nNow, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his\\nwits to meet this threat.\\nThe hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted\\nlight from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.\\nI must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery\\non the bottom. I must grip tightly.\\nThe thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around\\nthe bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.\\nWho is operating that thing? Paul wondered. It has to be someone near. I\\ncould shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.\\nThe hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.\\nThe hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.\\nPaul\\'s right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed\\nand twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With\\na violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing\\'s nose against the metal\\n\\n\\x0cdoorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went\\ndead in his hand.\\nStill, he held it--to be certain.\\nPaul\\'s eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout\\nMapes.\\n\"Your father has sent for you,\" she said. \"There are men in the hall to\\nescort you.\"\\nPaul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sack-like dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his\\nhand.\\n\"I\\'ve heard of suchlike,\" she said. \"It would\\'ve killed me, not so?\"\\nHe had to swallow before he could speak. \"I . . . was its target.\"\\n\"But it was coming for me.\"\\n\"Because you were moving.\" And he wondered: Who is this creature?\\n\"Then you saved my life,\" she said.\\n\"I saved both our lives.\"\\n\"Seems like you could\\'ve let it have me and made your own escape,\" she said.\\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\\n\"The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.\"\\n\"How did you know where to find me?\"\\n\"Your mother told me. I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the\\nhall.\" She pointed to her right. \"Your father\\'s men are still waiting.\"\\nThose will be Hawat\\'s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this\\nthing.\\n\"Go to my father\\'s men,\" he said. \"Tell them I\\'ve caught a hunter-seeker in\\nthe house and they\\'re to spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off\\nthe house and its grounds immediately. They\\'ll know how to go about it. The\\noperator\\'s sure to be a stranger among us.\"\\nAnd he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn\\'t. The\\nseeker had been under control when she entered.\\n\"Before I do your bidding, manling,\" Mapes said, \"I must cleanse the way\\nbetween us. You\\'ve put a water burden on me that I\\'m not sure I care to support.\\nBut we Fremen pay our debts--be they black debts or white debts. And it\\'s known\\nto us that you\\'ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we\\'re\\ncertain sure of it. Mayhap there\\'s the hand guided that flesh-cutter.\"\\nPaul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd\\nwoman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.\\nHe thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him\\nshe would resent it. She\\'d told him what she knew and now she was going to do\\nhis bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat\\'s men in a minute.\\nHis mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He\\nlooked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He\\npaused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his\\nmemory--prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any\\nwhite in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.\\nStill gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped\\nup his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist\\nand buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.\\nShe\\'d said his mother was someplace down here--stairs . . . a weirding room.\\n', 10: '\\nWhat had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you\\ncarefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: \"Any road\\nfollowed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a\\nlittle bit to test that it\\'s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you\\ncannot see the mountain.\"\\n\\n\\x0c-from \"Muad\\'Dib: Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan\\nAt the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an\\noval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\\nOval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.\\nThrough the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white\\nsun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the hall. She\\nreturned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of\\ndried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.\\nJessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her\\nsliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a\\nfaint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.\\nSurely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one\\nindividual\\'s hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And\\nthere were ways to open any palm lock--as she had learned at school.\\nJessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm\\nagainst the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the\\nlines--a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the\\nsurface.\\nShe felt the click.\\nBut there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted\\nher hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.\\n\"There are men in the great hall say they\\'ve been sent by the Duke to get\\nyoung master Paul,\" Mapes said. \"They\\'ve the ducal signet and the guard has\\nidentified them.\" She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.\\nA cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That\\'s a good sign.\\n\"He\\'s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,\"\\nJessica said. \"If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next\\nroom. Paul may require a wakeshot.\"\\nAgain, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she\\ndetected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and\\nwhat it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.\\nHawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can\\'t be anything too\\nterrible in here.\\nShe pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval\\ndoor opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.\\nAn airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to the\\nfloor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat\\'s personal mark. The door was\\nleft propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down\\naccidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.\\nShe stepped over the lip into the little room.\\nWhy an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of\\nexotic creatures sealed off in special climates.\\nSpecial climate!\\nThat would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing\\nthings had to be irrigated.\\nThe door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open\\nsecurely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner\\ndoor, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She\\nrecognized Galach words, read:\\n\"O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God\\'s Creation; then, stand before it\\nand learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.\"\\nJessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door\\nopened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in\\nthe air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed\\ngreenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.\\nA yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Filter glass!\\n\\n\\x0cShe stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.\\n\"A wet-planet conservatory,\" she breathed:\\nPotted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa,\\na flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white\\nstriped akarso . . . roses . . .\\nEven roses!\\nShe bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to\\npeer around the room.\\nRhythmic noise invaded her senses.\\nShe parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of\\nthe room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise\\nwas a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a-gallop onto the metal bowl.\\nJessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a\\nmethodical inspection of the room\\'s perimeter. It appeared to be about ten\\nmeters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle\\ndifferences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this\\nwing long after the original building\\'s completion.\\nShe stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of\\nfilter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded with\\nexotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then\\nglimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent\\nout a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she\\nlooked at what it had watered: a fern tree.\\nWater everywhere in this room--on a planet where water was the most precious\\njuice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner\\nstillness.\\nShe glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon\\nabove cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the Shield\\nWall.\\nFilter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and\\nmore familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to\\nsurprise me with such a gift, but there hasn\\'t been time. And he\\'s been busy\\nwith more serious problems.\\nShe recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock\\ndoors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it\\nwas a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such\\nprecautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent\\ndust.\\nBut this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of\\nwaterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water\\nenough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis--possibly more.\\nJessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move\\nbrought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she\\nglimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan\\nleaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat\\'s daysigns on it, studied a message\\nwritten on the pad:\\n\"TO THE LADY JESSICA-May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the\\nroom to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a\\ndesirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.\\nMy kindest wishes,\\nMARGOT LADY FENRING\"\\nJessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor\\'s former\\nproxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded\\nimmediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was\\n\\n\\x0canother Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count\\nmarried his Lady.\\nEven as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out\\nthe hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code\\nphrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give\\nanother Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: \"On that path lies danger.\"\\nJessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots.\\nNothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She\\nreplaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.\\nSomething in the position of the pad? she wondered.\\nBut Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked\\nat the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under\\nsurface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the\\nsubtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:\\n\"Your son and Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to\\nattract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one\\nthat may escape detection.\" Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the\\nfull message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots; \"I do not know\\nthe exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The\\nthreat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The\\nH plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this\\nconservatory is safe. Forgive that I cannot tell more. My sources are few as my\\nCount is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.\"\\nJessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that\\ninstant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding\\nsomething in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother,\\npushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and\\nthe thing it clutched under the falling water.\\n\"Paul!\" She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. \"What is that?\"\\nHe spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: \"Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure. Water\\nshould short it out.\"\\n\"Immerse it!\" she commanded.\\nHe obeyed.\\nPresently, she said: \"Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.\"\\nHe brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal\\nin the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.\\nIt was dead.\\nShe dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the\\nroom with a searching intensity that she recognized--the B.G. Way.\\n\"This place could conceal anything,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'ve reason to believe it\\'s safe,\" she said.\\n\"My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said--\"\\n\"It was a hunter-seeker,\" she reminded him \"That means someone inside the\\nhouse to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing\\ncould\\'ve been spirited in here after Hawat\\'s investigation.\"\\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: \" . . . defection of a trusted\\ncompanion or lieutenant.\" Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\\n\"Hawat\\'s men are searching the house right now,\" he said. \"That seeker\\nalmost got the old woman who came to wake me.\"\\n\"The Shadout Mapes,\" Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs.\\n\"A summons from your father to--\"\\n\"That can wait,\" Paul said. \"Why do you think this room\\'s safe?\"\\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\\nHe relaxed slightly.\\nBut Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful\\nMother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul spoke matter of factly: \"It\\'s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have\\nto destroy them.\"\\nA rapping sounded at the airlock door--the code knock of one of Hawat\\'s\\ncorps.\\n\"Come in,\" Paul called.\\nThe door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia\\non his cap leaned into the room. \"There you are, sir,\" he said. \"The housekeeper\\nsaid you\\'d be here.\" He glanced around the room. \"We found a cairn in the cellar\\nand caught a man in it. He had a seeker console.\"\\n\"I\\'ll want to take part in the interrogation,\" Jessica said.\\n\"Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.\"\\n\"Nothing to identify him?\" she asked.\\n\"We\\'ve found nothing yet, my Lady.\"\\n\"Was he an Arrakeen native?\" Paul asked.\\nJessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.\\n\"He has the native look,\" the man said. \"Put into that cairn more\\'n a month\\nago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he\\ncame through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place\\nyesterday. I\\'ll stake my reputation on it.\"\\n\"No one questions your thoroughness,\" Jessica said.\\n\"I question it, my Lady. We should\\'ve used sonic probes down there.\"\\n\"I presume that\\'s what you\\'re doing now,\" Paul said.\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"Send word to my father that we\\'ll be delayed.\"\\n\"At once, sir.\" He glanced at Jessica. \"It\\'s Hawat\\'s order that under such\\ncircumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.\" Again, his\\neyes swept the room. \"What of this place?\"\\n\"I\\'ve reason to believe it safe,\" she said. \"Both Hawat and I have inspected\\nit.\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll mount guard outside here, m\\'Lady, until we\\'ve been over the house\\nonce more.\" He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door\\nclosed behind him.\\nPaul broke the sudden silence, saying: \"Had we better go over the house\\nlater ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss.\"\\n\"This wing was the only place I hadn\\'t examined,\" she said. \"I put if off to\\nlast because . . . \"\\n\"Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,\" he said.\\nShe darted a quick look at his face, questioning.\\n\"Do you distrust Hawat?\" she asked.\\n\"No, but he\\'s getting old . . . he\\'s overworked. We could take some of the\\nload from him.\"\\n\"That\\'d only shame him and impair his efficiency,\" she said. \"A stray insect\\nwon\\'t be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this. He\\'ll be\\nshamed that . . . \"\\n\"We must take our own measures,\" he said.\\n\"Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,\" she said. \"He\\ndeserves every respect and trust we can pay him . . . many times over.\"\\nPaul said: \"When my father is bothered by something you\\'ve done he says\\n\\'Bene Gesserit!\\' like a swear word.\"\\n\"And what is it about me that bothers your father?\"\\n\"When you argue with him.\"\\n\"You are not your father, Paul.\"\\nAnd Paul thought: It\\'ll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman\\nsaid about a traitor among us.\\n\"What\\'re you holding back?\" Jessica asked. \"This isn\\'t like you, Paul.\"\\nHe shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision,\\nshowed Paul the leaf, told him its message.\\n\"My father must learn of this at once,\" he said. \"I\\'ll radiograph it in code\\nand get if off.\"\\n\"No,\" she said. \"You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as\\npossible must learn about it.\"\\n\"Do you mean we should trust no one?\"\\n\"There\\'s another possibility,\" she said. \"This message may have been meant\\nto get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it\\'s true, but it may be\\nthat the only purpose was to get this message to us.\"\\nPaul\\'s face remained sturdily somber. \"To sow distrust and suspicion in our\\nranks, to weaken us that way,\" he said.\\n\"You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of\\nit, \" she said.\\n\"I understand.\"\\nShe turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest\\nwhere the sun of Arrakis was sinking--a yellowed ball above the cliffs.\\nPaul turned with her, said: \"I don\\'t think it\\'s Hawat, either. Is it\\npossible it\\'s Yueh?\"\\n\"He\\'s not a lieutenant or companion,\" she said. \"And I can assure you he\\nhates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.\"\\nPaul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn\\'t be\\nGurney . . . or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible.\\nThey\\'re all from families that\\'ve been loyal to us for generations--for good\\nreason.\\nJessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here!\\nShe looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal\\ngrounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard--lines of spice silos in it with\\nstilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders. She\\ncould see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of\\nthe Shield Wall--silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.\\nSlowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped\\nout. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a\\nclear, precise rhythm--a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink . . .\\nPaul stirred beside her in the dusky room.\\nBut Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was\\ntoo low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.\\nSomeone signaling!\\nShe tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.\\nOther lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little\\nyellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew\\nbrighter, began to wink back at the cliff--very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer,\\nblink!\\nAnd it was gone.\\nThe false star in the cliff winked out immediately.\\nSignals . . . and they filled her with premonition.\\nWhy were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why\\ncouldn\\'t they use the communications network?\\nThe answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by\\nagents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being\\nsent between his enemies--between Harkonnen agents.\\nThere came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat\\'s man;\\n\"All clear, sir . . . m\\'Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his\\nfather.\"\\n', 11: '\\n\\n\\x0cIt is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he\\nwalked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had\\nlived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its\\nintensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son\\nmight find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily\\nhoodwinked.\\n-from \"Muad\\'Dib: Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower\\noutside Arrakeen. The night\\'s first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above\\nthe southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone\\nlike parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen\\nglowed in the haze--yellow . . . white . . . blue.\\nHe thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the\\npopulous places of the planet: \"Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to\\ntake possession of this planet and end all dispute.\"\\nThe ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness.\\nWho was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the\\nHouses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis . . . and were\\nHarkonnen creatures almost to a man.\\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\\nThe rage was difficult to suppress.\\nHe saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from\\nArrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay\\nwas galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of\\nHawat\\'s lieutenant.\\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\\nHe shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field\\nwhere five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic\\nsentries.\\nBetter a cautious delay than . . .\\nThe lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for\\nadvancement, completely loyal.\\n\"Our Sublime Padishah Emperor . . . \"\\nIf the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor\\'s\\nprivate note to his \"Noble Duke\"--the disdainful allusions to veiled men and\\nwomen: \" . . . but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream\\nis to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?\"\\nThe Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class\\ndistinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the\\ndust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles\\nCaladan . . . but I\\'ll never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a\\nsudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but\\nthat it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this\\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy\\'s sake. If ever he\\'s to\\nhave a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis as a hell I\\'ve reached\\nbefore death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be\\nsomething.\\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him,\\nand for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney\\nHalleck often repeated-\"My lungs taste the air of Time\\nBlown past falling sands . . . \"\\n\\n\\x0cWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The\\ncentral wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert--barren rock,\\ndunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along\\nits rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy\\na future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.\\nProvided the Harkonnens hadn\\'t managed to infect even the Fremen with their\\npoisonous schemes.\\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\\nA scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet\\nbeneath his arms. Blast shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.\\nShuttle\\'s coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned\\nto the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to remain\\ncalm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter.\\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\\nThe men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their spacebags over their shoulders, shouting and\\nroistering like students returning from vacation.\\n\"Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That\\'s gravity, man!\" \"How many G\\'s does\\nthis place pull? Feels heavy.\" \"Nine-tenths of a G by the book.\"\\nThe crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.\\n\"Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where\\'s all the loot\\nthis place\\'s supposed to have?\" \"The Harkonnens took it with \\'em!\" \"Me for a hot\\nshower and a soft bed!\" \"Haven\\'t you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You\\nscrub your ass with sand!\" \"Hey! Can it! The Duke!\"\\nThe Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.\\nGurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one\\nshoulder, the neck of his nine-string baliset clutched in the other hand. They\\nwere long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such\\ndelicate music from the baliset.\\nThe Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived\\noutside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had\\ncalled him?\\n\"Gurney, the valorous.\"\\nHalleck\\'s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide\\nmouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip\\nslashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air\\nwas of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed.\\n\"Gurney,\" Leto said.\\n\"My Lord.\" He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. \"This is\\nthe last of them. I\\'d have preferred coming in with the first wave, but . . . \"\\n\"There are still some Harkonnens for you,\" the Duke said. \"Step aside with\\nme, Gurney, where we may talk.\"\\n\"Yours to command, my Lord.\"\\nThey moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men\\nstirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept\\nhis grip on the baliset.\\n\"How many men can you let Hawat have?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"Is Thufir in trouble. Sire?\"\\n\"He\\'s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on\\nthe entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of\\nsecurity, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare-men who won\\'t balk at a little knife work.\"\\n\"I can let him have three hundred of my best,\" Halleck said. \"Where shall I\\nsend them?\"\\n\"To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.\"\\n\"Shall I get about it at once, Sire?\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the\\nshuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is\\ngoing on about its business, and the shuttle\\'s supposed to make contact with a\\ncargo ship taking up a load of spice.\"\\n\"Our spice, m\\'Lord?\"\\n\"Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from\\nthe old regime. They\\'ve opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of\\nthe Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight\\nhundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men\\nto enlist with us.\"\\n\"How strong a persuasion, Sire?\"\\n\"I want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and\\nskills we need. The fact that they\\'re leaving suggests they\\'re not part of the\\nHarkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the\\ngroup, but he sees assassins in every shadow.\"\\n\"Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"And there are some he hasn\\'t found. But I think planting sleepers in this\\noutgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.\"\\n\"Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?\"\\n\"Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and play\\na tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may offer\\npositions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per cent higher wages\\nthan they received under the Harkonnens.\"\\n\"No more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with\\ntheir termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them . . . well.\\nSire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.\"\\nLeto spoke impatiently: \"Then use your own discretion in particular cases.\\nJust remember that the treasury isn\\'t bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent\\nwhenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune\\nmen--any with open sand experience.\"\\n\"I understand, Sire. \\'They shall come all for violence: their faces shall\\nsup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.\\' \"\\n\"A very moving quotation,\" the Duke said. \"Turn your crew over to a\\nlieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men\\ndown for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will\\ndirect them. And don\\'t forget the men for Hawat.\"\\n\"Three hundred of the best, Sire.\" He took up his spacebag. \"Where shall I\\nreport to you when I\\'ve completed my chores?\"\\n\"I\\'ve taken over a council room topside here. We\\'ll hold staff there. I want\\nto arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first.\"\\nHalleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto\\'s eye. \"Are you\\nanticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the\\nChange here.\"\\n\"Both open battle and secret,\" the Duke said. \"There\\'ll be blood aplenty\\nspilled here before we\\'re through.\"\\n\" \\'And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon\\nthe dry land,\\' \" Halleck quoted.\\nThe Duke sighed. \"Hurry back, Gurney.\"\\n\"Very good, m\\'Lord.\" The whipscar rippled to his grin. \" \\'Behold, as a wild\\nass in the desert, go I forth to my work.\\' \" He turned, strode to the center of\\nthe room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.\\nLeto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual\\namazement--a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases . . . and the\\nheart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.\\nPresently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift,\\nacknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda\\ncorpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through\\n\\n\\x0cchannels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were\\nsafe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the\\npopulation here appeared to boast more women than men.\\nThe Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the message\\nhad top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He\\nnodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.\\nCommand must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on\\nyour shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.\\nHe breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn\\nand face the impersonal doors.\\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\\n', 12: '\\nOver the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a\\npoor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad\\'Dib was to repeat many\\ntimes. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal\\ncommand post to participate in his father\\'s first full staff conference. The\\nwords of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell\\nwith dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with\\ndeath. They said: \"O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your\\nprayers. \"\\n-from \"Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,\" the Duke said, \"but when\\nit comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged\\nin . . . other things.\"\\nHe knew he wasn\\'t holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned,\\nstrode down the length of the long table and back.\\nThe Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It\\nwas an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old-fashioned\\nthree-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul\\nsat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with\\nthe hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.\\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: \"Hawat told me that\\nhouse was secure!\"\\nPaul spoke hesitantly: \"I was angry, too--at first. And I blamed Hawat. But\\nthe threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And\\nit would\\'ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many\\nothers--including Hawat.\"\\n\"Are you defending him?\" the Duke demanded.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"He\\'s getting old. That\\'s it. He should be--\"\\n\"He\\'s wise with much experience,\" Paul said. \"How many of Hawat\\'s mistakes\\ncan you recall?\"\\n\"I should be the one defending him,\" the Duke said. \"Not you.\"\\nPaul smiled.\\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son\\'s. \"You\\'ve .\\n. . matured lately, Son.\" He lifted his hand. \"It gladdens me.\" He matched his\\nson\\'s smile. \"Hawat will punish himself. He\\'ll direct more anger against himself\\nover this than both of us together could pour on him.\"\\nPaul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the\\nnight\\'s blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He\\nsaw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul\\nlooked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface\\nof the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.\\n\\n\\x0cThe door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it\\nlooking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of the\\ntable, stopped at attention facing Leto.\\n\"My Lord,\" he said, speaking to a point over Leto\\'s head, \"I have just\\nlearned how I failed you. It becomes necessary that I tender my resig--\"\\n\"Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,\" the Duke said. He waved to the\\nchair across from Paul. \"If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the\\nHarkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn\\'t count on\\nsimple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he\\ncame through this largely because of your training. You didn\\'t fail there!\" He\\ntapped the back of the empty chair. \"Sit down, I say!\"\\nHawat sank into the chair. \"But--\"\\n\"I\\'ll hear no more of it,\" the Duke said. \"The incident is past. We have\\nmore pressing business. Where are the others?\"\\n\"I asked them to wait outside while I--\"\\n\"Call them in.\"\\nHawat looked into Leto\\'s eyes. \"Sire, I--\"\\n\"I know who my true friends are, Thufir,\" the Duke said. \"Call in the men.\"\\nHawat swallowed. \"At once, my Lord.\" He swiveled in the chair, called to the\\nopen door: \"Gurney, bring them in.\"\\nHalleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly\\nserious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among\\nthem. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A\\nfaint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.\\n\"There\\'s coffee for those who want it,\" the Duke said.\\nHe looked over his men, thinking: They\\'re a good crew. A man could do far\\nworse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the\\nadjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.\\nPresently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded\\ntheir attention with a knuckle rap against the table.\\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \"our civilization appears to\\'ve fallen so deeply\\ninto the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the\\nImperium without the old ways cropping up.\"\\nDry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had\\nsaid the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood\\nhere. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.\\n\"I think first we\\'d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report\\non the Fremen,\" the Duke said. \"Thufir?\"\\nHawat glanced up. \"I\\'ve some economic matters to go into after my general\\nreport, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the\\nallies we need. They\\'re waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear\\nto be dealing openly. They\\'ve sent us a gift--stillsuits of their own\\nmanufacture . . . maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the\\nHarkonnens left behind, . . .\" He glanced down at the table. \"Their intelligence\\nreports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our\\ndealings with the Judge of the Change. They\\'ve also sent some incidental things-jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are\\nprocessing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.\"\\n\"You like these people, Thufir?\" asked a man down the table.\\nHawat turned to face his questioner. \"Duncan Idaho says they\\'re to be\\nadmired.\"\\nPaul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: \"Have you\\nany new information on how many Fremen there are?\"\\nHawat looked at Paul. \"From food processing and other evidence, Idaho\\nestimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all\\ntold. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We\\'ve reason\\n\\n\\x0cto believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give\\ntheir allegiance to someone called Liet.\"\\n\"That\\'s something new,\" Leto said.\\n\"It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this\\nLiet may be a local deity.\"\\nAnother man down the table cleared his throat, asked: \"Is it certain they\\ndeal with the smugglers?\"\\n\"A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy\\nload of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen-day\\njourney.\"\\n\"It appears,\" the Duke said, \"that the smugglers have redoubled their\\noperations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We\\nshouldn\\'t worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet--it\\'s\\nalways done. But to have them completely outside our observation--that\\'s not\\ngood.\"\\n\"You have a plan. Sire,\" Hawat asked.\\nThe Duke looked at Halleck. \"Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an\\nembassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them I\\'ll\\nignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here\\nestimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their\\noperations have been costing them four times that amount.\"\\n\"What if the Emperor gets wind of this?\" Halleck asked. \"He\\'s very jealous\\nof his CHOAM profits, m\\'Lord.\"\\nLeto smiled. \"We\\'ll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV\\nand deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight\\nthat! And we\\'ll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the\\nHarkonnen system. No more graft!\"\\nA grin twisted Halleck\\'s face. \"Ahh, m\\'Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would\\nthat I could see the Baron\\'s face when he learns of this.\"\\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. \"Thufir, did you get those account books you said\\nyou could buy?\"\\n\"Yes, my Lord. They\\'re being examined in detail even now. I\\'ve skimmed them,\\nthough, and can give a first approximation.\"\\n\"Give it, then.\"\\n\"The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and\\nthirty Standard days.\"\\nA muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been\\nbetraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.\\nHalleck murmured: \" \\'For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of\\nthe treasure hid in the sand.\\' \"\\n\"You see, gentlemen,\" Leto said. \"Is there anyone here so naive he believes\\nthe Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely\\nbecause the Emperor ordered it?\"\\nThere was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.\\n\"We will have to take it at the point of the sword,\" Leto said. He turned to\\nHawat. \"This\\'d be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers,\\nharvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?\"\\n\"A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the\\nJudge of the Change, my Lord,\" Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a\\nfolder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. \"They neglect to mention\\nthat less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have\\ncarryalls to fly them to spice sands--that everything the Harkonnens left us is\\nready to break down and fall apart. We\\'ll be lucky to get half the equipment\\ninto operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it\\'s still working six months from\\nnow.\"\\n\"Pretty much as we expected,\" Leto said. \"What\\'s the firm estimate on basic\\nequipment?\"\\n\\n\\x0cHawat glanced at his folder. \"About nine hundred and thirty harvester-factories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty\\nornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation . . . carryalls, a\\nlittle under a thousand.\"\\nHalleck said: \"Wouldn\\'t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild\\nfor permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?\"\\nThe Duke looked at Hawat. \"Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?\"\\n\"We must pursue other avenues for now,\" Hawat said. \"The Guild agent wasn\\'t\\nreally negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain--one Mentat to\\nanother--that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how\\nlong a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him\\nagain.\"\\nOne of Halleck\\'s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped:\\n\"There\\'s no justice in this!\"\\n\"Justice?\" The Duke looked at the man. \"Who asks for justice? We make our\\nown justice. We make it here on Arrakis--win or die, Do you regret casting your\\nlot with us, sir?\"\\nThe man stared at the Duke, then: \"No, Sire. You couldn\\'t turn and I could\\ndo nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but . . .\" He shrugged. \" . . .\\nwe must all feel bitter at times.\"\\n\"Bitterness I understand,\" the Duke said. \"But let us not rail about justice\\nas long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you\\nharbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may\\nspeak his mind.\"\\nHalleck stirred, said: \"I think what rankles, Sire, is that we\\'ve had no\\nvolunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as \\'Leto the Just\\' and\\npromise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn\\'t cost them anything.\"\\n\"They don\\'t know yet who\\'s going to win this exchange,\" the Duke said. \"Most\\nof the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them\\nfor this; one can only despise them.\" He looked at Hawat. \"We were discussing\\nequipment. Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with\\nthis machinery?\"\\nHawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.\\nA solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the\\nway down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get\\na better look at it.\\nPaul leaned forward, staring at the machine.\\nScaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was\\nabout one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was\\nbasically a long, bug-like body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.\\n\"This is a harvester factory,\" Hawat said. \"We chose one in good repair for\\nthis projection. There\\'s one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of\\nImperial ecologists, though, and it\\'s still running . . . although I don\\'t know\\nhow . . . or why.\"\\n\"If that\\'s the one they call \\'Old Maria,\\' it belongs in a museum,\" an aide\\nsaid. \"I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over\\ntheir workers\\' heads. Be good or you\\'ll be assigned to \\'Old Maria.\\' \"\\nChuckles sounded around the table.\\nPaul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the\\nprojection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the\\ntable, said: \"Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?\"\\nQuick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then\\nthought: No--they have to face the realities here.\\n\"There\\'re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one\\ngulp,\" Hawat said. \"Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the\\nspicing\\'s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and\\ndevour it at their leisure.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Why don\\'t we shield them?\" Paul asked.\\n\"According to Idaho\\'s report,\" Hawat said, \"shields are dangerous in the\\ndesert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around.\\nIt appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We\\'ve the Fremen word on this\\nand no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the\\nsietch.\"\\n\"None at all?\" Paul asked.\\n\"It\\'d be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand\\npeople,\" Hawat said. \"Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw\\nno shields or any indication of their use.\"\\n\"It\\'s a puzzle,\" the Duke said.\\n\"The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,\" Hawat said. \"They\\nhad repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy\\nexpenditure for shield replacements and parts.\"\\n\"Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?\" Paul asked.\\n\"It doesn\\'t seem likely,\" Hawat said. \"It\\'s theoretically possible, of\\ncourse--a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no\\none\\'s ever been able to put it to the test.\"\\n\"We\\'d have heard about it before now,\" Halleck said. \"The smugglers have\\nclose contact with the Fremen and would\\'ve acquired such a device if it were\\navailable. And they\\'d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like an unanswered question of this importance,\" Leto said.\\n\"Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.\"\\n\"We\\'re already working on it, my Lord.\" He cleared his throat. \"Ah-h, Idaho\\ndid say one thing: he said you couldn\\'t mistake the Fremen attitude toward\\nshields. He said they were mostly amused by them.\"\\nThe Duke frowned, then: \"The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.\"\\nHawat gestured to his aide at the projector.\\nThe solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a\\nwinged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. \"This is a\\ncarryall,\" Hawat said. \"It\\'s essentially a large \\'thopter, whose sole function\\nis to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a\\nsandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of\\ngetting in and getting out with as much as possible.\"\\n\"Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,\" the Duke said.\\nLaughter was abrupt and too loud.\\nAn ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.\\n\"These \\'thopters are fairly conventional,\" Hawat said. \"Major modifications\\ngive them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas\\nagainst sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded--possibly discarding\\nthe shield generator\\'s weight for greater range.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like this de-emphasis on shields,\" the Duke muttered. And he\\nthought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won\\'t even be able to\\nescape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to\\ndrive out such thoughts, said: \"Let\\'s get to the working estimate. What\\'ll our\\nprofit figure be?\"\\nHawat turned two pages in his notebook. \"After assessing the repairs and\\noperable equipment, we\\'ve worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It\\'s\\nbased naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.\" He closed\\nhis eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: \"Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and\\nsalaries were held to fourteen per cent. We\\'ll be lucky to make it at thirty per\\ncent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the\\nCHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very\\nnarrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then\\nshould be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.\"\\nHe opened his eyes. \"Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"We\\'re working for a solid and permanent planetary base,\" the Duke said. \"We\\nhave to keep a large percentage of the people happy--especially the Fremen.\"\\n\"Most especially the Fremen,\" Hawat agreed.\\n\"Our supremacy on Caladan,\" the Duke said, \"depended on sea and air power.\\nHere, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include\\nair power, but it\\'s possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of\\n\\'thopter shields.\" He shook his head. \"The Harkonnens relied on turnover from\\noff planet for some of their key personnel. We don\\'t dare. Each new lot would\\nhave its quota of provocateurs.\"\\n\"Then we\\'ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,\"\\nHawat said. \"Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the\\nHarkonnen average.\"\\n\"There it is,\" the Duke said, \"exactly as we expected. We\\'ll have to move\\nfast with the Fremen. I\\'d like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the\\nfirst CHOAM audit.\"\\n\"That\\'s not much time, Sire,\" Hawat said.\\n\"We don\\'t have much time, as you well know. They\\'ll be here with Sardaukar\\ndisguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they\\'ll\\nship in, Thufir?\"\\n\"Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more. Guild troop-transport\\ncosts being what they are.\"\\n\"Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us\\nhave a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and\\nmatters will be much different--profits or no profits.\"\\n\"We\\'ll do our best, Sire.\"\\nPaul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat\\'s\\ngreat age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides.\\nAged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and\\nburned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin\\nset of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.\\nSo much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.\\n\"We\\'re presently in a war of assassins,\" the Duke said, \"but it has not\\nachieved full scale. Thufir, what\\'s the condition of the Harkonnen machine\\nhere?\"\\n\"We\\'ve eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord.\\nNo more than three Harkonnen cells remain--perhaps a hundred people in all.\"\\n\"These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,\" the Duke said, \"were they\\npropertied?\"\\n\"Most were well situated, my Lord--in the entrepreneur class.\"\\n\"I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each\\nof them,\" the Duke said. \"File copies with the Judge of the Change. We\\'ll take\\nthe legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their\\nproperty, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure\\nthe Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.\"\\nThufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. \"A move\\nworthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn\\'t think of it first.\"\\nHalleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul\\'s face. The\\nothers were smiling and nodding.\\nIt\\'s wrong, Paul thought. This\\'ll only make the others fight all the harder.\\nThey\\'ve nothing to gain by surrendering.\\nHe knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this\\nwas the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.\\n\" \\'I have been a stranger in a strange land,\\' \" Halleck quoted.\\nPaul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible,\\nwondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?\\nThe Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck.\\n\"Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and\\nconsider ourselves lucky. They\\'re all in useful categories.\"\\n\"No more?\" The Duke pursed his lips, then: \"Well, pass the word along to--\"\\nA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the\\nguard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke\\'s ear.\\nLeto waved him back, said: \"Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy\\nstaff.\"\\nPaul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex\\nthat made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho\\'s dark round\\nface turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but\\nPaul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\\nIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: \"We\\'ve taken a force of\\nHarkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a\\ncourier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the\\nHarkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier--badly wounded him. We were bringing\\nhim here for treatment by our medics when he died. I\\'d seen how badly off the\\nman was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw\\nsomething away.\" Idaho glanced down at Leto. \"A knife, m\\'Lord, a knife the like\\nof which you\\'ve never seen.\"\\n\"Crysknife?\" someone asked.\\n\"No doubt of it,\" Idaho said. \"Milky white and glowing with a light of its\\nown like.\" He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged\\nhandle protruding from it.\\n\"Keep that blade in its sheath!\"\\nThe voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and\\npenetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.\\nA tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the\\nguard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the\\nhood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue--no white in them at all.\\n\"Let him enter,\" Idaho whispered.\\n\"Pass that man,\" the Duke said.\\nThe guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.\\nThe man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.\\n\"This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned\\nus of the false band,\" Idaho said.\\n\"Welcome, sir,\" Leto said. \"And why shouldn\\'t we unsheath this blade?\"\\nStilgar glanced at Idaho, said: \"You observed the customs of cleanliness and\\nhonor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.\"\\nHis gaze swept the others in the room. \"But I do not know these others. Would\\nyou have them defile an honorable weapon?\"\\n\"I am the Duke Leto,\" the Duke said. \"Would you permit me to see this\\nblade?\"\\n\"I\\'ll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,\" Stilgar said, and, as a\\nmutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined\\nhand. \"I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.\"\\nIn the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that\\nradiated from him. He was a leader--a Fremen leader.\\nA man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: \"Who\\'s he to\\ntell us what rights we have on Arrakis?\"\\n\"It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the\\ngoverned,\" the Fremen said. \"Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a\\ncertain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.\" He passed a\\ndark glance across Idaho. \"They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without\\nour consent.\"\\nHalleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on\\ntheir faces. Halleck said: \"The Duke Leto determines whether--\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"One moment, please,\" Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held\\nthem. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the\\nFremen: \"Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects\\nmy dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts. If it is\\nyour custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered--by me.\\nAnd if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you\\nhave but to name it.\"\\nThe Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing\\na thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he\\nbent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.\\nAs the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho\\'s voice\\nboomed across the room: \"Hold!\"\\nInto the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: \"We thank you, Stilgar, for\\nthe gift of your body\\'s moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is\\ngiven.\" And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.\\nAside to the Duke, he said; \"Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That\\nwas a token of respect.\"\\nLeto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul\\'s eye, a rueful grin on his\\nson\\'s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as\\nunderstanding came to his men.\\nThe Fremen looked at Idaho, said: \"You measured well in my sietch, Duncan\\nIdaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?\"\\n\"He\\'s asking me to enlist with him. Sire,\" Idaho said.\\n\"Would he accept a dual allegiance?\" Leto asked.\\n\"You wish me to go with him, Sire?\"\\n\"I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,\" Leto said, and he\\ncould not keep the urgency out of his voice.\\nIdaho studied the Fremen. \"Would you have me under these conditions,\\nStilgar? There\\'d be times when I\\'d have to return to serve my Duke.\"\\n\"You fight well and you did your best for our friend,\" Stilgar said. He\\nlooked at Leto. \"Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a\\nmark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites\\nobserved, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides.\\nThere is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.\"\\n\"Duncan?\" Leto asked.\\n\"I understand, Sire,\" Idaho said.\\n\"It is agreed, then,\" Leto said.\\n\"Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho.\" Stilgar said. \"The body of our friend\\nremains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us.\"\\nLeto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat\\'s eye. Hawat nodded,\\nhis expression pleased.\\n\"I will await below,\" Stilgar said, \"while Idaho makes farewell with his\\nfriends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time\\nto release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.\"\\nStilgar started to turn away.\\n\"Will you not stay a while?\" Leto asked.\\nThe Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture,\\nadjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube\\nbefore the veil settled into place.\\n\"Is there reason to stay?\" the Fremen asked.\\n\"We would honor you,\" the Duke said.\\n\"Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon,\" the Fremen said. He shot another\\nglance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.\\n\"If the other Fremen match him, we\\'ll serve each other well,\" Leto said.\\nIdaho spoke in a dry voice: \"He\\'s a fair sample, Sire.\"\\n\"You understand what you\\'re to do, Duncan?\"\\n\"I\\'m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Much depends on you, Duncan. We\\'re going to need at least five battalions\\nof those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.\"\\n\"This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent\\nbunch.\" Idaho hesitated, then: \"And, Sire, there\\'s one other thing. One of the\\nmercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen\\nfriend. The mercenary says there\\'s a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for\\nanyone who\\'ll bring in a single crysknife.\"\\nLeto\\'s chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. \"Why do they want one\\nof those blades so badly?\"\\n\"The knife is ground from a sandworm\\'s tooth; it\\'s the mark of the Fremen,\\nSire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They\\'d\\nquestion me unless I were known. I don\\'t look Fremen. But . . . \"\\n\"Piter de Vries,\" the Duke said.\\n\"A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,\" Hawat said.\\nIdaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.\\n\"Guard that knife,\" the Duke said.\\n\"I understand, m\\'Lord.\" He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. \"I\\'ll\\nreport soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language.\" He\\nsaluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.\\nThey heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.\\nA look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.\\n\"We\\'ve much to do, Sire,\" Halleck said.\\n\"And I keep you from your work,\" Leto said.\\n\"I have the report on the advance bases,\" Hawat said. \"Shall I give it\\nanother time, Sire?\"\\n\"Will it take long?\"\\n\"Not for a briefing. It\\'s said among the Fremen that there were more than\\ntwo hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert\\nBotanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there\\nare reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.\"\\n\"Equipment in them?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"According to the reports I have from Duncan.\"\\n\"Where are they located?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"The answer to that question,\" Hawat said, \"is invariably: \\'Liet knows.\\' \"\\n\"God knows,\" Leto muttered.\\n\"Perhaps not. Sire,\" Hawat said. \"You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could\\nhe have been referring to a real person?\"\\n\"Serving two masters,\" Halleck said. \"It sounds like a religious quotation.\"\\n\"And you should know,\" the Duke said.\\nHalleck smiled.\\n\"This Judge of the Change,\" Leto said, \"the Imperial ecologist--Kynes . . .\\nWouldn\\'t he know where those bases are?\"\\n\"Sire,\" Hawat cautioned, \"this Kynes is an Imperial servant.\"\\n\"And he\\'s a long way from the Emperor,\" Leto said. \"I want those bases.\\nThey\\'d be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our\\nworking equipment.\"\\n\"Sire!\" Hawat said. \"Those bases are still legally His Majesty\\'s fief.\"\\n\"The weather here\\'s savage enough to destroy anything,\" the Duke said. \"We\\ncan always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases\\nexist.\"\\n\" \\'Twere dangerous to commandeer them,\" Hawat said. \"Duncan was clear on one\\nthing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the\\nFremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.\"\\nPaul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the\\nway they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father\\'s\\nattitude.\\n\"Listen to him, Father,\" Paul said in a low voice. \"He speaks truth.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Sire,\" Hawat said, \"those bases could give us material to repair every\\npiece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It\\'d be\\nrash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from\\nthe Imperium. We mustn\\'t forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.\"\\n\"Do it gently, then,\" the Duke said. \"I wish to know only if those bases\\nexist.\"\\n\"As you will, Sire.\" Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.\\n\"All right, then,\" the Duke said. \"We know what we have ahead of us--work.\\nWe\\'ve been trained for it. We\\'ve some experience in it. We know what the rewards\\nare and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments.\" He\\nlooked at Halleck. \"Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.\"\\n\" \\'I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,\\' \" Halleck\\nintoned.\\n\"Someday I\\'ll catch that man without a quotation and he\\'ll look undressed,\"\\nthe Duke said.\\nChuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.\\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. \"Set up another command post for intelligence and\\ncommunications on this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, I\\'ll want to see\\nyou.\"\\nHawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned\\naway, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping\\ntheir chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.\\nIt ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men\\nto leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had\\njust seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an\\nargument to top it off.\\nFor the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility\\nof defeat--not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that\\nof the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of\\nthe situation.\\nMy father is desperate, he thought. Things aren\\'t going well for us at all.\\nAnd Hawat--Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference-subtle hesitations, signs of unrest.\\nHawat was deeply troubled by something.\\n\"Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son,\" the Duke said. \"It\\'ll be\\ndawn soon, anyway. I\\'ll inform your mother.\" He got to his feet, slowly,\\nstiffly. \"Why don\\'t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on\\nthem for some rest.\"\\n\"I\\'m not very tired, sir.\"\\n\"As you will.\"\\nThe Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of\\nthe table.\\nLike a caged animal, Paul thought.\\n\"Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?\" Paul asked.\\nThe Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. \"We\\'ve\\ndiscussed the possibility many times.\"\\n\"The old woman seemed so sure of herself,\" Paul said. \"And the message\\nMother--\"\\n\"Precautions have been taken,\" the Duke said. He looked around the room, and\\nPaul marked the hunted wildness in his father\\'s eyes. \"Remain here. There are\\nsome things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir.\" He turned,\\nstrode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.\\nPaul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been\\nempty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman\\'s\\nwarning: \" . . . for the father, nothing.\"\\n', 13: '\\n\\n\\x0cOn that first day when Muad\\'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his\\nfamily, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy\\nand they ventured to shout: \"Mahdi!\" But their shout was more a question than a\\nstatement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan\\nal-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on\\nthe mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to\\nthem that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.\\n-from \"Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard\\ndirected him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in\\nan adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as\\nHawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with,\\nin addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen \"H\"\\nhad been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.\\n\"The chairs are liberated but quite safe,\" Hawat said. \"Where is Paul,\\nSire?\"\\n\"I left him in the conference room. I\\'m hoping he\\'ll get some rest without\\nme there to distract him.\"\\nHawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting\\noff the noise of static and electronic sparking.\\n\"Thufir,\" Leto said, \"the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract\\nmy attention.\"\\n\"M\\'Lord?\"\\nThe Duke pursed his lips. \"Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.\" He\\nraised a hand as Hawat started to speak. \"Ignore the Emperor\\'s hoard. He\\'d\\nsecretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object\\nif something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?\"\\nHawat shook his head. \"We\\'ve few men to spare. Sire.\"\\n\"Use some of Idaho\\'s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip\\noff planet. A raid on Giedi Prime--there are tactical advantages to such a\\ndiversion, Thufir.\"\\n\"As you say, my Lord.\" Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of\\nnervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must\\nknow I\\'ve private reports of traitors. Well--best quiet his fears immediately.\\n\"Thufir,\" he said, \"since you\\'re one of the few I can trust completely,\\nthere\\'s another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we\\nmust keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces . . . but I have two\\nnew reports.\"\\nHawat turned, stared at him.\\nAnd Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.\\nInstead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only\\nincreased Hawat\\'s agitation.\\nLeto studied the old man and, presently, said: \"You\\'ve been holding\\nsomething back, old friend. I should\\'ve suspected when you were so nervous\\nduring Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full\\nconference?\"\\nHawat\\'s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny\\nwrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he\\nsaid: \"My Lord, I don\\'t quite know how to broach this.\"\\n\"We\\'ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,\" the Duke said. \"You\\nknow you can broach any subject with me.\"\\nHawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This\\nis the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I\\nhurt him?\\n\"Well?\" Leto demanded.\\n\\n\\x0cHawat shrugged. \"It\\'s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen\\ncourier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We\\'ve good reason to\\nbelieve Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note--it\\'s a\\nthing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It\\'s susceptible to\\nvarious interpretations.\"\\n\"What\\'s the delicate content of this note?\"\\n\"Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual\\ndestruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full\\nerasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely\\nsuggestive.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\nHawat rubbed at his lips. \"It says: \\' . . . eto will never suspect, and when\\nthe blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to\\ndestroy him.\\' The note was under the Baron\\'s own seal and I\\'ve authenticated the\\nseal.\"\\n\"Your suspicion is obvious,\" the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.\\n\"I\\'d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,\" Hawat said. \"My Lord, what if .\\n. .\"\\n\"The Lady Jessica,\" Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. \"Couldn\\'t\\nyou wring the facts out of this Pardee?\"\\n\"Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted\\nthe courier. The courier, I\\'m certain, did not know what he carried.\"\\n\"I see.\"\\nLeto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can\\'t\\nbe anything in it. I know my woman.\\n\"My Lord, if--\"\\n\"No!\" the Duke barked. \"There\\'s a mistake here that--\"\\n\"We cannot ignore it, my Lord.\"\\n\"She\\'s been with me for sixteen years! There\\'ve been countless opportunities\\nfor--You yourself investigated the school and the woman!\"\\nHawat spoke bitterly: \"Things have been known to escape me.\"\\n\"It\\'s impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides\\nline--meaning Paul, too. They\\'ve already tried once. Could a woman conspire\\nagainst her own son?\"\\n\"Perhaps she doesn\\'t conspire against her son. And yesterday\\'s attempt\\ncould\\'ve been a clever sham.\"\\n\"It couldn\\'t have been a sham.\"\\n\"Sire, she isn\\'t supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know?\\nWhat if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?\"\\n\"She\\'d have moved long before now. Poison in my drink . . . a stiletto at\\nnight. Who has had better opportunity?\"\\n\"The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to\\nkill. There\\'s a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art\\namong vendettas.\"\\nThe Duke\\'s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. It\\ncannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.\\n\"What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"An interpretation I\\'ve considered,\" Hawat said. \"Still . . . \"\\nThe Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious.\\nSuspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will\\nmake another man careless.\\n\"What do you suggest?\" the Duke whispered.\\n\"For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all\\ntimes. I will see it\\'s done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for\\nthe job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There\\'s a young man\\n\\n\\x0cwe\\'ve been training in Idaho\\'s troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as\\na replacement. He\\'s gifted in diplomacy.\"\\n\"Don\\'t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.\"\\n\"Of course not, Sire.\"\\n\"And what about Paul?\"\\n\"Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh.\"\\nLeto turned his back on Hawat. \"I leave it in your hands.\"\\n\"I shall use discretion, my Lord.\"\\nAt least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: \"I will take a\\nwalk. If you need me, I\\'ll be within the perimeter. The guard can--\"\\n\"My Lord, before you go, I\\'ve a filmclip you should read. It\\'s a first approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You\\'ll recall you asked me to\\nreport on it.\"\\nThe Duke paused, spoke without turning. \"Will it not wait?\"\\n\"Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was\\n\\'Mahdi!\\' They directed the term at the young master. When they--\"\\n\"At Paul?\"\\n\"Yes, my Lord. They\\'ve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to\\nthem, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the\\nfamiliar messiah pattern.\"\\n\"They think Paul is this . . . this . . . \"\\n\"They only hope, my Lord.\" Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.\\nThe Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. \"I\\'ll look at it later.\"\\n\"Certainly, my Lord.\"\\n\"Right now, I need time to . . . think.\"\\n\"Yes, my Lord.\"\\nThe Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his\\nright down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little\\nattention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and\\nhalls . . . people who saluted and stood aside for him.\\nIn time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep\\non the table with a guard\\'s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow.\\nThe Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony\\noverlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing\\nthe Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.\\n\"At ease,\" the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the\\nbalcony rail.\\nA predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight\\noverhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the\\nsouthern horizon, the night\\'s second moon peered through a thin dust haze--an\\nunbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.\\nAs the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs,\\nfrosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill.\\nHe shivered.\\nAnger shot through him.\\nThe Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he\\nthought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand!\\nAnd he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw--as the\\nhawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his\\ntunic.\\nTo the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell\\nopalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of\\ndawn striking across a broken horizon.\\nIt was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.\\nSome things beggar likeness, he thought.\\nHe had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered\\nred horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the\\n\\n\\x0cnight\\'s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw\\ngreat puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of\\nviolet . . . like giant footsteps.\\n\"It\\'s a beautiful morning. Sire,\" the guard said.\\n\"Yes, it is.\"\\nThe Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it\\ncould become a good home for my son.\\nThen he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them\\nwith strange scythe-like devices--dew gatherers. Water so precious, here that\\neven the dew must be collected.\\nAnd it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.\\n', 14: '\\n\"There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in\\nwhich you discover your father is a man--with human flesh.\"\\n-from \"Collected Sayings of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe Duke said: \"Paul, I\\'m doing a hateful thing, but I must.\" He stood\\nbeside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference\\nroom for their breakfast. The thing\\'s sensor arms hung limply over the table,\\nreminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.\\nThe Duke\\'s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and\\nits roiling of dust against the morning sky.\\nPaul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen\\nreligious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat\\'s experts and\\nPaul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.\\n\"Mahdi!\"\\n\"Lisan al-Gaib!\"\\nHe could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what\\nthey hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said:\\nKwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading\\nthis strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.\\n\"A hateful thing,\" the Duke said.\\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\\nLeto turned, looked down at his son. \"Because the Harkonnens think to trick\\nme by making me distrust your mother. They don\\'t know that I\\'d sooner distrust\\nmyself.\"\\n\"I don\\'t understand, sir.\"\\nAgain, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its\\nmorning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled\\nover into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.\\nSlowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to\\nPaul about the mysterious note.\\n\"You might just as well mistrust me,\" Paul said.\\n\"They have to think they\\'ve succeeded,\" the Duke said. \"They must think me\\nthis much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham.\"\\n\"But, sir! Why?\"\\n\"Your mother\\'s response must not be an act. Oh, she\\'s capable of a supreme\\nact . . . but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke out a traitor. It must\\nseem that I\\'ve been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does\\nnot suffer greater hurt.\"\\n\"Why do you tell me, Father? Maybe I\\'ll give it away.\"\\n\"They\\'ll not watch you in this thing,\" the Duke said. \"You\\'ll keep the\\nsecret. You must.\" He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. \"This way,\\nif anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth--that I never\\ndoubted her, not for the smallest instant. I should want her to know this.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul recognized the death thoughts in his father\\'s words, spoke quickly:\\n\"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, sir. The--\"\\n\"Be silent, Son.\"\\nPaul stared at his father\\'s back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the\\nneck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.\\n\"You\\'re just tired, Father.\"\\n\"I am tired,\" the Duke agreed. \"I\\'m morally tired. The melancholy\\ndegeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we were\\nsuch strong people once.\"\\nPaul spoke in quick anger: \"Our House hasn\\'t degenerated!\"\\n\"Hasn\\'t it?\"\\nThe Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a\\ncynical twist of mouth. \"I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet . .\\n. my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through\\ntheir marriageable daughters.\" He shrugged. \"So, I . . . \"\\n\"Mother has explained this to me.\"\\n\"Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura,\" the Duke\\nsaid. \"I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.\"\\n\"You lead well,\" Paul protested. \"You govern well. Men follow you willingly\\nand love you.\"\\n\"My propaganda corps is one of the finest,\" the Duke said. Again, he turned\\nto stare out at the basin. \"There\\'s greater possibility for us here on Arrakis\\nthan the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes I think it\\'d have been\\nbetter if we\\'d run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes I wish we could sink back\\ninto anonymity among the people, become less exposed to . . . \"\\n\"Father!\"\\n\"Yes, I am tired,\" the Duke said. \"Did you know we\\'re using spice residue as\\nraw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?\"\\n\"Sir?\"\\n\"We mustn\\'t run short of filmbase,\" the Duke said. \"Else, how could we flood\\nvillage and city with our information? The people must learn how well I govern\\nthem. How would they know if we didn\\'t tell them?\"\\n\"You should get some rest,\" Paul said.\\nAgain, the Duke faced his son. \"Arrakis has another advantage I almost\\nforgot to mention. Spice is in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in\\nalmost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to\\nsome of the most common poisons of the Assassins\\' Handbook. And the need to\\nwatch every drop of water puts all food production--yeast culture, hydroponics,\\nchemavit, everything--under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large\\nsegments of our population with poison--and we cannot be attacked this way,\\neither. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.\"\\nPaul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: \"I have to have\\nsomeone I can say these things to, Son.\" He sighed, glanced back at the dry\\nlandscape where even the flowers were gone now--trampled by the dew gatherers,\\nwilted under the early sun.\\n\"On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,\" the Duke said. \"Here, we must\\nscrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of\\nyou if anything happens to me? You\\'ll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla\\nHouse--running, hunted.\"\\nPaul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his\\nfather this despondent.\\n\"To hold Arrakis,\" the Duke said, \"one is faced with decisions that may cost\\none his self-respect.\" He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black\\nbanner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. \"That\\nhonorable banner could come to mean many evil things.\"\\nPaul swallowed in a dry throat. His father\\'s words carried futility, a sense\\nof fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. \"Power and\\nfear,\" he said. \"The tools of statecraft. I must order new emphasis on guerrilla\\ntraining for you. That filmclip there--they call you \\'Mahdi\\'--\\'Lisan al-Gaib\\'-as a last resort, you might capitalize on that.\"\\nPaul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet\\ndid its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.\\n\"What\\'s keeping that ecologist?\" the Duke muttered. \"I told Thufir to have\\nhim here early.\"\\n', 15: '\\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the\\nways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of\\nPortraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong\\nresemblance between them--my father and this man in the portrait--both with\\nthin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. \"Princess-daughter,\" my father said, \"I would that you\\'d been older when it came time for\\nthis man to choose a woman.\" My father was 71 at the time and looking no older\\nthan the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that\\ninstant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked\\nthe political necessities that made them enemies.\\n-\"In My Father\\'s House\" by the Princess Irulan\\nHis first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr.\\nKynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely\\ninteresting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitted the\\nancient prophecy so precisely. He had \"the questing eyes,\" and the air of\\n\"reserved candor.\"\\nOf course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother\\nGoddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene. Still,\\nthere was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.\\nThey met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field\\'s administration\\nbuilding. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby\\nlike a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and\\nthe faint air-distortion of a shield around him.\\nKynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for\\nthem there!\\nThe planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back.\\nHe strode on ahead toward the building\\'s entrance--the dark hole in plastic-coated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less\\nsuitable than a cave.\\nMovement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the\\nmoment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.\\nThe entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them\\nheavily armed--slow-pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them came a tall\\nman, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides\\ncrest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with\\nthe garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a\\nfree-swinging, striding rhythm.\\nBeside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the\\nface. The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But\\nthe young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw\\nand knew things all around him that were not visible to others. And he wore the\\nsame style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made one think the boy\\nhad always worn such clothing.\\n\"The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see,\" went the prophecy.\\nKynes shook his head, telling himself: They\\'re just people.\\n\\n\\x0cWith the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized-Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against\\nHalleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.\\n\"You may call the Duke \\'my Lord \\' or \\'Sire.\\' \\'Noble Born\\' also is correct,\\nbut usually reserved for more formal occasions. The son may be addressed as\\n\\'young Master\\' or \\'my Lord.\\' The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks\\nlittle familiarity.\"\\nAnd Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They\\'ll learn soon\\nenough who\\'s master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that\\nMentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do\\nthey?\\nThe import of Hawat\\'s questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the\\nImperial bases. And it was obvious they\\'d learned of the bases from Idaho.\\nI will have Stilgar send Idaho\\'s head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.\\nThe ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots\\ncrunching the sand.\\nKynes bowed. \"My Lord, Duke.\"\\nAs he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto\\nhad studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit,\\nand low boots. The man\\'s hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side,\\nrevealing long sandy hair, a sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless blue-within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets.\\n\"You\\'re the ecologist,\" the Duke said.\\n\"We prefer the old title here, my Lord,\" Kynes said. \"Planetologist.\"\\n\"As you wish,\" the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. \"Son, this is the\\nJudge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the\\nforms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.\" He glanced at\\nKynes. \"And this is my son.\"\\n\"My Lord,\" Kynes said.\\n\"Are you a Fremen?\" Paul asked.\\nKynes smiled. \"I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But I\\nam in His Majesty\\'s service, the Imperial Planetologist.\"\\nPaul nodded, impressed by the man\\'s air of strength. Halleck had pointed\\nKynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: \"The man\\nstanding there with the Fremen escort--the one moving now toward the\\nornithopter.\"\\nPaul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight\\nmouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul\\'s ear: \"Odd sort of fellow.\\nHas a precise way of speaking--clipped off, no fuzzy edges--razor-apt.\"\\nAnd the Duke, behind them, had said: \"Scientist type.\"\\nNow, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the\\nimpact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.\\n\"I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,\" the\\nDuke said.\\n\"I hope they fit well, my Lord,\" Kynes said. \"They\\'re of Fremen make and as\\nnear as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.\"\\n\"I was concerned that you said you couldn\\'t take us into the desert unless\\nwe wore these garments,\" the Duke said. \"We can carry plenty of water. We don\\'t\\nintend to be out long and we\\'ll have air cover--the escort you see overhead\\nright now. It isn\\'t likely we\\'d be forced down.\"\\nKynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: \"You never\\ntalk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.\"\\nHalleck stiffened. \"The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!\"\\nLeto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: \"Our ways are\\nnew here, Gurney. We must make allowances.\"\\n\"As you wish, Sire.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes,\" Leto said. \"These suits and the\\nconsideration for our welfare will be remembered.\"\\nOn impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said: \"\\n\\'The gift is the blessing of the river.\\' \"\\nThe words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had\\nleft in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting\\nrepose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: \"Lisan al-Gaib!\"\\nKynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard\\naway. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the\\nbuilding.\\n\"Most interesting,\" Leto said.\\nKynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: \"Most of the desert\\nnatives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They mean no\\nharm.\" But he thought of the words of the legend: \"They will greet you with Holy\\nWords and your gifts will be a blessing.\"\\nLeto\\'s assessment of Kynes--based partly on Hawat\\'s brief verbal report\\n(guarded and full of suspicions)--suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen.\\nKynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen\\nwere testing their new freedom to enter urban areas--but it had seemed an honor\\nguard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his\\ntongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul\\'s question had\\nbeen direct and pertinent.\\nKynes had gone native.\\n\"Shouldn\\'t we be going, Sire?\" Halleck asked.\\nThe Duke nodded. \"I\\'ll fly my own \\'thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me\\nto direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.\"\\n\"One moment, please,\" Kynes said. \"With your permission, Sire, I must check\\nthe security of your suits.\"\\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: \"I have concern for my own\\nflesh as well as yours . . . my Lord. I\\'m well aware of whose throat would be\\nslit should harm befall you two while you\\'re in my care.\"\\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may\\noffend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet . .\\n. to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about\\nhim?\\nThe thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels.\\n\"We\\'re in your hands,\" the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe, saw\\nHalleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where\\nhe was. \"And, if you\\'d be so kind,\" the Duke said, \"I\\'d appreciate an\\nexplanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.\"\\n\"Certainly,\" Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals,\\nspeaking as he examined the suit. \"It\\'s basically a micro-sandwich--a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system.\" He adjusted the shoulder seals.\\n\"The skin-contact layer\\'s porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled\\nthe body . . . near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers . . . \"\\nKynes tightened the chest fit. \". . . include heat exchange filaments and salt\\nprecipitators. Salt\\'s reclaimed.\"\\nThe Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: \"Most interesting.\"\\n\"Breathe deeply,\" Kynes said.\\nThe Duke obeyed.\\nKynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. \"Motions of the body,\\nespecially breathing,\" he said, \"and some osmotic action provide the pumping\\nforce.\" He loosened the chest fit slightly. \"Reclaimed water circulates to\\ncatchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck.\"\\nThe Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube.\\n\"Efficient and convenient,\" he said. \"Good engineering.\"\\n\\n\\x0cKynes knelt, examined the leg seals. \"Urine and feces are processed in the\\nthigh pads,\" he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned\\nflap there. \"In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this\\ntube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through\\nthe mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working\\norder, you won\\'t lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day--even if you\\'re\\ncaught in the Great Erg.\"\\n\"A thimbleful a day,\" the Duke said.\\nKynes pressed a finger against the suit\\'s forehead pad, said: \"This may rub\\na little. It if irritates you, please tell me. I could slit-patch it a bit\\ntighter.\"\\n\"My thanks,\" the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes\\nstepped back, realizing that it did feel better now--tighter and less\\nirritating.\\nKynes turned to Paul. \"Now, let\\'s have a look at you, lad.\"\\nA good man but he\\'ll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.\\nPaul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd\\nsensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his\\nforeconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn\\na stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurney\\'s\\ninexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the\\nchest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known\\nwhat he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he\\nhad known it was to prevent friction blisters.\\nKynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. \"You\\'ve worn a\\nstillsuit before?\" he asked.\\n\"This is the first time.\"\\n\"Then someone adjusted it for you?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do\\nthat?\"\\n\"It . . . seemed the right way.\"\\n\"That it most certainly is.\"\\nAnd Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: \"He shall know your ways\\nas though born to them.\"\\n\"We waste time,\" the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting \\'thopter, led the\\nway, accepting the guard\\'s salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his safety\\nharness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others\\nclambered aboard.\\nKynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft-soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of\\nfiltered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred\\nalive.\\nSo soft! he thought.\\n\"All secure, Sire,\" Halleck said.\\nLeto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip--once, twice. They were\\nairborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them\\nupward in a steep, hissing climb.\\n\"Southeast over the Shield Wall,\" Kynes said. \"That\\'s where I told your\\nsandmaster to concentrate his equipment.\"\\n\"Right.\"\\nThe Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard\\npositions as they headed southeast.\\n\"The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of\\nsophistication,\" the Duke said.\\n\"Someday I may show you a sietch factory,\" Kynes said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"I would find that interesting,\" the Duke said. \"I note that suits are\\nmanufactured also in some of the garrison cities.\"\\n\"Inferior copies,\" Kynes said. \"Any Dune man who values his skin wears a\\nFremen suit.\"\\n\"And it\\'ll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?\"\\n\"Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major\\nwater loss is through the palms of your hands,\" Kynes said. \"You can wear suit\\ngloves if you\\'re not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the\\nopen desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It\\ninhibits perspiration.\"\\nThe Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield\\nWall--chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black lines of\\nfault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space\\nand left it where it smashed.\\nThey crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading\\nacross it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into the\\nbasin--a dry delta outlined against darker rock.\\nKynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the\\nstillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the\\nwaist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the\\nDuke and his son carried knives in wrist sheathes and the sheathes appeared well\\nworn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed\\nstrength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.\\n\"When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you\\nsay we observed the rules?\" Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to their\\ncourse.\\n\"The Harkonnens left; you came,\" Kynes said.\\n\"And is everything as it should be?\" Leto asked.\\nMomentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes\\' jaw. \"As\\nPlanetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the Imperium . .\\n. my Lord.\"\\nThe Duke smiled grimly. \"But we both know the realities.\"\\n\"I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.\"\\n\"Indeed? And what is your work?\"\\nIn the brief silence, Paul thought: He\\'s pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul\\nglanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren\\nlandscape.\\nKynes spoke stiffly: \"You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.\"\\n\"Of course.\"\\n\"It is mostly dry land biology and botany . . . some geological work--core\\ndrilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire\\nplanet.\"\\n\"Do you also investigate the spice?\"\\nKynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man\\'s cheek. \"A curious\\nquestion, my Lord.\"\\n\"Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those\\nof the Harkonnens. I don\\'t care if you study the spice as long as I share what\\nyou discover.\" He glanced at the planetologist. \"The Harkonnens discouraged\\ninvestigation of the spice, didn\\'t they?\"\\nKynes stared back without answering.\\n\"You may speak plainly,\" the Duke said, \"without fear for your skin.\"\\n\"The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,\" Kynes muttered. And he\\nthought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough\\nto enlist with him?\\nThe Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. \"I detect a sour\\nnote in your voice, sir. We\\'ve waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh?\\n\\n\\x0cAnd we expect you to realize immediately that we\\'re different from the\\nHarkonnens?\"\\n\"I\\'ve seen the propaganda you\\'ve flooded into sietch and village,\" Kynes\\nsaid. \" \\'Love the good Duke!\\' Your corps of--\"\\n\"Here now!\" Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window,\\nleaned forward.\\nPaul put a hand on Halleck\\'s arm.\\n\"Gurney!\" the Duke said. He glanced back. \"This man\\'s been long under the\\nHarkonnens.\"\\nHalleck sat back. \"Ayah.\"\\n\"Your man Hawat\\'s subtle,\" Kynes said, \"but his object\\'s plain enough.\"\\n\"Will you open those bases to us, then?\" the Duke asked.\\nKynes spoke curtly: \"They\\'re His Majesty\\'s property.\"\\n\"They\\'re not being used.\"\\n\"They could be used.\"\\n\"Does His Majesty concur?\"\\nKynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. \"Arrakis could be an Eden if its\\nrulers would look up from grubbing for spice!\"\\nHe didn\\'t answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: \"How is a\\nplanet to become an Eden without money?\"\\n\"What is money,\" Kynes asked, \"if it won\\'t buy the services you need?\"\\nAh, now! the Duke thought. And he said: \"We\\'ll discuss this another time.\\nRight now, I believe we\\'re coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do I hold the\\nsame course?\"\\n\"The same course,\" Kynes muttered.\\nPaul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop\\naway in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged shelf.\\nBeyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with\\nhere and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of\\nsomething not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Paul\\ncouldn\\'t be sure.\\n\"Are there any plants down there?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Some,\" Kynes said. \"This latitude\\'s life-zone has mostly what we call minor\\nwater stealers--adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the\\ntrace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned\\nhow to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate\\nthat life or you die.\"\\n\"You mean steal water from each other?\" Paul asked. The idea outraged him,\\nand his voice betrayed his emotion.\\n\"It\\'s done,\" Kynes said, \"but that wasn\\'t precisely my meaning. You see, my\\nclimate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of water at all\\ntimes. You waste nothing that contains moisture.\"\\nAnd the Duke thought: \" . . . my climate!\"\\n\"Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord,\" Kynes said. \"There\\'s a\\nblow coming up from the west.\"\\nThe Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked the\\n\\'thopter around, noting the way the escort\\'s wings reflected milky orange from\\nthe dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.\\n\"This should clear the storm\\'s edge,\" Kynes said.\\n\"That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it,\" Paul said. \"Will it really\\ncut the strongest metals?\"\\n\"At this altitude, it\\'s not sand but dust,\" Kynes said. \"The danger is lack\\nof visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.\"\\n\"We\\'ll see actual spice mining today?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Very likely,\" Kynes said.\\nPaul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his\\nmother called \"registering\" the person. He had Kynes now--tune of voice, each\\n\\n\\x0cdetail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the man\\'s\\nrobe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged strangely. It was said\\nthat desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked small necessities.\\nPerhaps the bulges came from such a sash--certainly not from a concealed shield\\nbelt. A copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of\\nKynes\\' robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the\\nhood which was thrown back over his shoulders.\\nHalleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear\\ncompartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck tuned\\nthe instrument, then returned his attention to their course.\\n\"What would you like to hear, young Master?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"You choose, Gurney,\" Paul said.\\nHalleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang\\nsoftly:\\n\"Our fathers ate manna in the desert,\\nIn the burning places where whirlwinds came.\\nLord, save us from that horrible land!\\nSave us . . . oh-h-h-h, save us\\nFrom the dry and thirsty land.\"\\nKynes glanced at the Duke, said: \"You do travel with a light complement of\\nguards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?\"\\n\"Gurney?\" The Duke chuckled. \"Gurney\\'s one of a kind. I like him with me for\\nhis eyes. His eyes miss very little.\"\\nThe planetologist frowned.\\nWithout missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:\\n\"For I am like an owl of the desert, o!\\nAiyah! am like an owl of the des-ert!\"\\nThe Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel,\\nthumbed it to life, said: \"Leader to Escort Gemma. Flying object at nine\\no\\'clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?\"\\n\"It\\'s merely a bird,\" Kynes said, and added: \"You have sharp eyes.\"\\nThe panel speaker crackled, then: \"Escort Gemma. Object examined under full\\namplification. It\\'s a large bird.\"\\nPaul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of\\nintermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be. Every sense\\nwas at full alert.\\n\"I\\'d not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,\" the\\nDuke said.\\n\"That\\'s likely an eagle,\" Kynes said. \"Many creatures have adapted to this\\nplace.\"\\nThe ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their\\ntwo thousand meters\\' altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and\\nescort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.\\n\"Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?\" the Duke asked.\\nHalleck\\'s music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.\\n\"Not from the deep desert,\" Kynes said. \"Men have walked out of the second\\nzone several times. They\\'ve survived by crossing the rock areas where worms\\nseldom go.\"\\nThe timbre of Kynes\\' voice held Paul\\'s attention. He felt his sense come\\nalert the way they were trained to do.\\n\"Ah-h, the worms,\" the Duke said. \"I must see one sometime.\"\\n\"You may see one today,\" Kynes said. \"Wherever there is spice, there are\\nworms.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Always?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"Always.\"\\n\"Is there relationship between worm and spice?\" the Duke asked.\\nKynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. \"They defend\\nspice sands. Each worm has a--territory. As to the spice . . . who knows? Worm\\nspecimens we\\'ve examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical interchanges\\nwithin them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated\\nacid forms elsewhere. I\\'ll give you my monograph on the subject.\"\\n\"And a shield\\'s no defense?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"Shields!\" Kynes sneered. \"Activate a shield within the worm zone and you\\nseal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to attack a\\nshield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.\"\\n\"How are worms taken, then?\"\\n\"High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is\\nthe only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm,\" Kynes said. \"They\\ncan be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of\\nits own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a\\nlarge worm entirely. They\\'re incredibly tough.\"\\n\"Why hasn\\'t an effort been made to wipe them out?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Too expensive,\" Kynes said. \"Too much area to cover.\"\\nPaul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings,\\ntold him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he thought: If\\nthere\\'s a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy\\nthe spice.\\n\"No one will have to walk out of the desert soon,\" the Duke said. \"Trip\\nthese little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our workers\\nwill be wearing them before long. We\\'re setting up a special rescue service.\"\\n\"Very commendable,\" Kynes said.\\n\"Your tone says you don\\'t agree,\" the Duke said.\\n\"Agree? Of course I agree, but it won\\'t be much use. Static electricity from\\nsandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They\\'ve been tried\\nhere before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm\\'s hunting\\nyou there\\'s not much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty\\nminutes.\"\\n\"What would you advise?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"You ask my advice?\"\\n\"As planetologist, yes.\"\\n\"You\\'d follow my advice?\"\\n\"If I found it sensible.\"\\n\"Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone.\"\\nThe Duke turned his attention from the controls. \"That\\'s all?\"\\n\"That\\'s all. Never travel alone.\"\\n\"What if you\\'re separated by a storm and forced down?\" Halleck asked. \"Isn\\'t\\nthere anything you could do?\"\\n\"Any thing covers much territory,\" Kynes said.\\n\"What would you do?\" Paul asked.\\nKynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the\\nDuke. \"I\\'d remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If I were outside\\nthe worm zone or in rock, I\\'d stay with the ship. If I were down in open sand,\\nI\\'d get away from the ship as fast as I could. About a thousand meters would be\\nfar enough. Then I\\'d hide beneath my robe. A worm would get the ship, but it\\nmight miss me.\"\\n\"Then what?\" Halleck asked.\\nKynes shrugged. \"Wait for the worm to leave.\"\\n\"That\\'s all?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out,\" Kynes said. \"You must\\nwalk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins--head for the nearest rock\\nzone. There are many such zones. You might make it.\"\\n\"Drum sand?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"A condition of sand compaction,\" Kynes said. \"The slightest step sets it\\ndrumming. Worms always come to that.\"\\n\"And a tidal dust basin?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries.\\nSome are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary who\\nstep into them.\"\\nHalleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:\\n\"Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there,\\nWaiting for the innocents to pass.\\nOh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert,\\nLest you seek a lonely epitaph.\\nThe perils of the--\"\\nHe broke off, leaned forward. \"Dust cloud ahead, Sire.\"\\n\"I see it, Gurney.\"\\n\"That\\'s what we seek,\" Kynes said.\\nPaul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low\\non the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.\\n\"One of your factory crawlers,\" Kynes said. \"It\\'s on the surface and that\\nmeans it\\'s on spice. The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has\\nbeen centrifugally removed. There\\'s no other cloud quite like it.\"\\n\"Aircraft over it,\" the Duke said.\\n\"I see two . . . three . . . four spotters,\" Kynes said. \"They\\'re watching\\nfor wormsign.\"\\n\"Wormsign?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They\\'ll have seismic probes on the\\nsurface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show.\" Kynes swung\\nhis gaze around the sky. \"Should be a carryall wing around, but I don\\'t see it.\"\\n\"The worm always comes, eh?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"Always.\"\\nPaul leaned forward, touched Kynes\\' shoulder. \"How big an area does each\\nworm stake out?\"\\nKynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions.\\n\"That depends on the size of the worm.\"\\n\"What\\'s the variation?\" the Duke asked.\\n\"Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones--\"\\nHe broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship bucked as its tail\\npods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft\\nbecame a full \\'thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle\\nbeat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler.\\n\"Is that wormsign?\"\\nKynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.\\nPaul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and\\nPaul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged ahead,\\nbut now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some\\nthree kilometers away.\\nWhere the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward\\nthe horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into the\\ndistance, came an elongated mount-in-motion--a cresting of sand. It reminded\\nPaul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the\\nsurface.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Worm,\" Kynes said. \"Big one.\" He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from\\nthe panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the grid chart on\\nrollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: \"Calling crawler at\\nDelta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign\\nwarning. Acknowledge, please.\" He waited.\\nThe panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: \"Who calls Delta\\nAjax niner? Over.\"\\n\"They seem pretty calm about it,\" Halleck said.\\nKynes spoke into the microphone: \"Unlisted flight--north and east of you\\nabout three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept course, your position,\\nestimated contact twenty-five minutes.\"\\nAnother voice rumbled from the speaker: \"This is Spotter Control. Sighting\\nconfirmed. Stand by for contact fix.\" There was a pause, then: \"Contact in\\ntwenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who\\'s on that unlisted\\nflight? Over.\"\\nHalleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke.\\n\"Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?\"\\n\"Yes. Why?\"\\n\"Who\\'d be listening?\"\\n\"Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference.\"\\nAgain, the speaker crackled, then: \"This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus\\ncredit for that spot? Over.\"\\nHalleck glanced at the Duke.\\nKynes said: \"There\\'s a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first\\nworm warning. They want to know--\"\\n\"Tell them who had first sight of that worm,\" Halleck said.\\nThe Duke nodded.\\nKynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone; \"Spotter credit to the Duke\\nLeto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.\"\\nThe voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of\\nstatic: \"We read and thank you.\"\\n\"Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,\" Halleck ordered.\\n\"Tell them it\\'s the Duke\\'s wish.\"\\nKynes took a deep breath, then: \"It\\'s the Duke\\'s wish that you divide the\\nbonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.\"\\n\"Acknowledged and thank you,\" the speaker said.\\nThe Duke said: \"I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in\\npublic relations.\"\\nKynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.\\n\"This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety,\" Halleck\\nsaid. \"Word will get around. It was on an area working frequency--not likely\\nHarkonnen agents heard.\" He glanced out at their air cover. \"And we\\'re a pretty\\nstrong force. It was a good risk.\"\\nThe Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory\\ncrawler. \"What happens now?\"\\n\"There\\'s a carryall wing somewhere close,\" Kynes said. \"It\\'ll come in and\\nlift off the crawler.\"\\n\"What if the carryall\\'s wrecked?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"Some equipment is lost,\" Kynes said. \"Get in close over the crawler, my\\nLord; you\\'ll find this interesting.\"\\nThe Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into\\nturbulent air over the crawler.\\nPaul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic\\nmonster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide\\ntracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked\\ninto dark sand in front of it.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Rich spice bed by the color,\" Kynes said. \"They\\'ll continue working until\\nthe last minute.\"\\nThe Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent\\nas he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler. A glance left and\\nright showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.\\nPaul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler\\'s pipe vents, looked\\nout over the desert at the approaching worm track.\\n\"Shouldn\\'t we be hearing them call in the carryall?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"They usually have the wing on a different frequency,\" Kynes said.\\n\"Shouldn\\'t they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?\" the Duke\\nasked. \"There should be twenty-six men on that machine down there, not to\\nmention cost of equipment.\"\\nKynes said: \"You don\\'t have enough ex--\"\\nHe broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: \"Any of you see the\\nwing? He isn\\'t answering.\"\\nA garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override\\nsignal, then silence and the first voice: \"Report by the numbers! Over.\"\\n\"This is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling\\noff northwest. I don\\'t see him now. Over.\"\\n\"Spotter one: negative. Over.\"\\n\"Spotter two: negative. Over.\"\\n\"Spotter three: negative. Over.\"\\nSilence.\\nThe Duke looked down. His own craft\\'s shadow was just passing over the\\ncrawler. \"Only four spotters, is that right?\"\\n\"Correct,\" Kynes said.\\n\"There are five in our party,\" the Duke said. \"Our ships are larger. We can\\ncrowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two\\neach.\"\\nPaul did the mental arithmetic, said: \"That\\'s three short.\"\\n\"Why don\\'t they have two carryalls to each crawler?\" barked the Duke.\\n\"You don\\'t have enough extra equipment,\" Kynes said.\\n\"All the more reason we should protect what we have!\"\\n\"Where could that carryall go?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"Could\\'ve been forced down somewhere out of sight,\" Kynes said.\\nThe Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its\\nswitch. \"How could they lose sight of a carryall?\"\\n\"They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign,\" Kynes said.\\nThe Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. \"This is your Duke.\\nWe are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner\\'s crew. All spotters are ordered\\nto comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the west. Over.\" He\\nreached down, punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his\\nown air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.\\nKynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the\\nspeaker: \" . . . almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We\\ncan\\'t leave that for a damned worm! Over.\"\\n\"Damn the spice!\" the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone, said: \"We\\ncan always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of\\nyou. Draw straws or decide any way you like who\\'s to go. But you\\'re going, and\\nthat\\'s an order!\" He slammed the microphone back into Kynes\\' hands, muttered:\\n\"Sorry,\" as Kynes shook an injured finger.\\n\"How much time?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Nine minutes,\" Kynes said.\\nThe Duke said: \"This ship has more power than the others. If we took off\\nunder jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man.\"\\n\"That sand\\'s soft,\" Kynes said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings,\\nSire,\" Halleck said.\\n\"Not on this ship,\" the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the\\n\\'thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the \\'thopter\\nto a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.\\nThe crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint\\nmechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his\\ndoor.\\nImmediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon--heavy and\\npungent.\\nWith a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the\\nother side of the crawler. The Duke\\'s own escort swooped in to land in line with\\nhim.\\nPaul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the \\'thopters were dwarfed by\\nit--gnats beside a warrior beetle.\\n\"Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,\" the Duke said. He manually\\ncranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod\\ncontrols. \"Why the devil aren\\'t they coming out of that machine?\"\\n\"They\\'re hoping the carryall will show up,\" Kynes said. \"They still have a\\nfew minutes.\" He glanced off to the east.\\nAll turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there\\nwas a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.\\nThe Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: \"Two\\nof you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry one more\\nman that way. We\\'re not leaving any men for that monster.\" He keyed back to the\\nworking frequency, barked: \"All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This\\nis a command from your Duke! On the double or I\\'ll cut that crawler apart with a\\nlasgun!\"\\nA hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear,\\nanother at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the\\nsand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped\\ndown to a track and then to the sand.\\nThe Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step,\\nshouted: \"Two men each into your spotters.\"\\nThe man in the patched robe began lolling off pairs of his crew, pushing\\nthem toward the craft waiting on the other side.\\n\"Four over here!\" the Duke shouted. \"Four into that ship back there!\" He\\njabbed a finger at an escort \\'thopter directly behind him. The guards were just\\nwrestling the shield generator out of it. \"And four into that ship over there!\"\\nHe pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. \"Three each\\ninto the others! Run, you sand dogs!\"\\nThe tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand\\nfollowed by three of his companions.\\n\"I hear the worm, but I can\\'t see it,\" Kynes said.\\nThe others heard it then--an abrasive slithering, distant and growing\\nlouder.\\n\"Damn sloppy way to operate,\" the Duke muttered.\\nAircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a\\ntime in his home planet\\'s jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and\\ncarrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.\\nThe spice workers slogged up to the side of the \\'thopter, started climbing\\nin behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.\\n\"In you go, boys!\" he snapped. \"On the double!\"\\nPaul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of\\nfear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He\\nfiled the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to\\n\\n\\x0corder tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn\\'t\\nwatch such things.\\nThe last man came gasping into the rear, said. \"The worm! It\\'s almost on us!\\nBlast off!\"\\nThe Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: \"We still have almost three\\nminutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?\" He shut his\\ndoor, checked it.\\n\"Almost exactly, my Lord,\" Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this\\nduke.\\n\"All secure here, Sire,\" Halleck said.\\nThe Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the\\nigniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.\\nThe take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed\\nthe people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls-gently, surely. The \\'thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his\\ninstruments, glanced left and right at his wings.\\n\"She\\'s very heavy, Sire,\" Halleck said.\\n\"Well within the tolerances of this ship,\" the Duke said. \"You didn\\'t really\\nthink I\\'d risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?\"\\nHalleck grinned, said: \"Not a bit of it, Sire.\"\\nThe Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve--climbing over the crawler.\\nPaul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent\\nmachine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from\\nthe crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the\\nfactory.\\n\"The worm is now beneath the crawler,\" Kynes said. \"You are about to witness\\na thing few have seen.\"\\nFlecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine\\nbegan to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to\\nthe right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the\\nair now for hundreds of meters around.\\nThen they saw it!\\nA wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white\\nspokes within it. The hole\\'s diameter was at least twice the length of the\\ncrawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a\\nbillow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.\\n\"Gods, what a monster!\" muttered a man beside Paul.\\n\"Got all our floggin\\' spice!\" growled another.\\n\"Someone is going to pay for this,\" the Duke said. \"I promise you that.\"\\nBy the very flatness of his father\\'s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He\\nfound that he shared it. This was criminal waste!\\nIn the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.\\n\"Bless the Maker and His water,\" Kynes murmured. \"Bless the coming and going\\nof Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His\\npeople.\"\\n\"What\\'s that you\\'re saying?\" the Duke asked.\\nBut Kynes remained silent.\\nPaul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at\\nthe back of Kynes\\' head. One of them whispered: \"Liet.\"\\nKynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.\\nAnother of the rescued men began coughing--dry and rasping. Presently, he\\ngasped: \"Curse this hell hole!\"\\nThe tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said; \"Be you still,\\nCoss. You but worsen your cough.\" He stirred among the men until he could look\\nthrough them at the back of the Duke\\'s head. \"You be the Duke Leto, I warrant,\"\\nhe said. \"It\\'s to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it\\nthere until you came along.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,\" Halleck muttered.\\nPaul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the\\ncorner of his father\\'s jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.\\nLeto began easing his \\'thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a\\nnew sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths and\\nnow, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north\\naway from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with\\nhardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.\\n\"Who\\'s that down there?\" the Duke barked.\\n\"Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,\" said the tall Dune man.\\n\"Why wasn\\'t something said about them?\"\\n\"It was the chance they took, Soor,\" the Dune man said.\\n\"My Lord,\" said Kynes, \"these men know it\\'s of little use to do anything\\nabout men trapped on the desert in worm country.\"\\n\"We\\'ll send a ship from base for them!\" the Duke snapped.\\n\"As you wish, my Lord,\" Kynes said. \"But likely when the ship gets here\\nthere\\'ll be no one to rescue.\"\\n\"We\\'ll send a ship, anyway,\" the Duke said.\\n\"They were right beside where the worm came up,\" Paul said. \"How\\'d they\\nescape?\"\\n\"The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,\" Kynes\\nsaid.\\n\"You waste fuel here, Sire,\" Halleck ventured.\\n\"Aye, Gurney.\"\\nThe Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came\\ndown from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.\\nPaul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so\\nsurely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back\\nout of its depths.\\nFremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might\\nbe left out of your worries as a matter of course--because they are in no\\ndanger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!\\n\"What were Fremen doing on that crawler?\" Paul asked.\\nKynes whirled.\\nThe tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul--blue within blue within blue.\\n\"Who be this lad?\" he asked.\\nHalleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: \"This is Paul\\nAtreides, the ducal heir.\"\\n\"Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?\" the man asked.\\n\"They fit the description,\" Paul said.\\nKynes snorted. \"You can\\'t tell Fremen just by looking at them!\" He looked at\\nthe Dune man. \"You. Who were those men?\"\\n\"Friends of one of the others,\" the Dune man said. \"Just friends from a\\nvillage who wanted to see the spice sands.\"\\nKynes turned away. \"Fremen!\"\\nBut he was remembering the words of the legend: \"The Lisan al-Gaib shall see\\nthrough all subterfuge.\"\\n\"They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,\" the Dune man said. \"We should\\nnot speak unkindly on them.\"\\nBut Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had\\nbrought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.\\nPaul spoke dryly: \"A terrible place for them to die.\"\\nWithout turning, Kynes said; \"When God hath ordained a creature to die in a\\nparticular place. He causeth that creature\\'s wants to direct him to that place.\"\\nLeto turned a hard stare at Kynes.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had\\nobserved here: This Duke was concerned more over the men that he was over the\\nspice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off\\nthe loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men\\'s lives had him in\\na rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be\\ndifficult to defeat.\\nAgainst his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself:\\nI like this Duke.\\n', 16: '\\nGreatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part\\nupon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences\\ngreatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is\\nprojected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is\\nwhat uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that\\npermits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional\\ngreatness will destroy a man.\\n-from \"Collected Sayings of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nIn the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been\\nlighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the\\nblack bull\\'s head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil\\npainting of the Old Duke.\\nBeneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections\\nof the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the\\ngreat table--little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each\\nsetting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier\\nremained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the\\nmechanism of the poison-snooper had been concealed.\\nPausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about\\nthe poison-snooper and what it signified in his society.\\nAll of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language--the precise\\nand delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone\\ntry chaumurky tonight--poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas--poison in the\\nfood?\\nHe shook his head.\\nBeside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was\\nenough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family\\nfor more than a year.\\nFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate\\nyellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the\\nhousekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands\\nceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their\\nhands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After\\nthe dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the\\ntowels.\\nHow typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of the\\nspirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his\\nstomach.\\n\"The custom stops here!\" he muttered.\\nHe saw a serving woman--one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had\\nrecommended--hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke\\nsignaled with upraised hand. She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the\\ntable toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes.\\n\"My Lord wishes?\" She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.\\nHe gestured. \"Have these basins and towels removed.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"But . . . Noble Born . . .\" She looked up, mouth gaping.\\n\"I know the custom!\" he barked. \"Take these basins to the front door. While\\nwe\\'re eating and until we\\'ve finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup\\nof water. Understood?\"\\nHer leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger . . .\\nWith sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the\\nwater squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the\\nwretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.\\nHis face clouded, and he growled: \"I\\'m posting a guard to see that my orders\\nare carried out to the letter.\"\\nHe whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled\\nin his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water\\nand waves--days of grass instead of sand--dazed summers that had whipped past\\nhim like windstorm leaves.\\nAll gone.\\nI\\'m getting old, he thought. I\\'ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in\\nwhat? An old woman\\'s greed.\\nIn the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing\\nin front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of\\norange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the\\ngroup a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment\\nimporter, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a\\nrepresentative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in\\nreplacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard-faced woman whose\\nescort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various\\nsmuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.\\nMost of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type--decorative,\\nprecisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.\\nEven without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the\\ngroup, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors--a long dress\\nalmost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed\\nhair.\\nHe realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his\\nrecent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these\\nshades--that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.\\nNearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in\\nglittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly\\ncombed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat-\"Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant\\nsurveillance.\"\\nThe Duke glanced around the room.\\nThere was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger\\nArrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop. The\\nDuke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would\\nmake. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.\\nHe\\'ll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden\\nchill that this was another death thought.\\nPaul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at\\nthe clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the\\nunobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the\\nchattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks\\nlocked on festering thoughts--voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in\\nevery breast.\\nI\\'m in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.\\nHe knew his mood\\'s source. He hadn\\'t wanted to attend this function, but his\\nfather had been firm. \"You have a place--a position to uphold. You\\'re old enough\\nto do this. You\\'re almost a man.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to\\nthe group around the Lady Jessica.\\nAs Leto approached Jessica\\'s group, the water-shipper was asking: \"Is it\\ntrue the Duke will put in weather control?\"\\nFrom behind the man, the Duke said: \"We haven\\'t gone that far in our\\nthinking, sir.\"\\nThe man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. \"Ah-h, the\\nDuke,\" he said. \"We missed you.\"\\nLeto glanced at Jessica. \"A thing needed doing.\" He returned his attention\\nto the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins,\\nadding: \"As far as I\\'m concerned, the old custom ends now.\"\\n\"Is this a ducal order, m\\'Lord?\" the man asked.\\n\"I leave that to your own . . . ah . . . conscience,\" the Duke said. He\\nturned, noting Kynes come up to the group.\\nOne of the women said: \"I think it\\'s a very generous gesture--giving water\\nto the--\" Someone shushed her.\\nThe Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style\\ndark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold\\nteardrop of rank at his collar.\\nThe water-shipper asked in an angry voice: \"Does the Duke imply criticism of\\nour custom?\"\\n\"This custom has been changed,\" Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the\\nfrown on Jessica\\'s face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it\\'ll\\nincrease rumors of friction between us.\\n\"With the Duke\\'s permission,\" the water-shipper said, \"I\\'d like to inquire\\nfurther about customs.\"\\nLeto heard the sudden oily tone in the man\\'s voice, noted the watchful\\nsilence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around\\nthe room.\\n\"Isn\\'t it almost time for dinner?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"But our guest has some questions,\" Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling\\nHawat\\'s memorandum: \". . . and this water-shipper is a man to watch--Lingar\\nBewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled\\nhim.\"\\n\"Water customs are so interesting,\" Bewt said, and there was a smile on his\\nface. \"I\\'m curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this\\nhouse. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people\\'s faces . . .\\nm\\'Lord?\"\\nLeto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his\\nmind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially\\nsince they now had Bewt\\'s signature over a contract of allegiance. The action\\nhad taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here.\\nIf water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal\\n. . . The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities\\nmight well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held\\nover the Harkonnens.\\n\"My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory,\" Jessica\\nsaid. She smiled at Leto. \"We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it\\nin trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of\\nArrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.\"\\nBless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.\\n\"Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,\" the Duke said. \"I\\'d\\nadvise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious\\ncommodity on Arrakis.\"\\n\\n\\x0cAnd he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt\\'s\\norganization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once. No man is\\ngoing to hold a club over my head!\\nBewt nodded, the smile still on his face. \"A commendable dream, my Lord.\" He\\nwithdrew a pace.\\nLeto\\'s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes\\' face. The man was\\nstaring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured--like a man in love . . . or caught\\nin a religious trance.\\nKynes\\' thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: \"And they\\nshall share your most precious dream. \"He spoke directly to Jessica: \"Do you\\nbring the shortening of the way?\"\\n\"Ah, Dr. Kynes,\" the water-shipper said. \"You\\'ve come in from tramping\\naround with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.\"\\nKynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: \"It is said in the\\ndesert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal\\ncarelessness.\"\\n\"They have many strange sayings in the desert,\" Bewt said, but his voice\\nbetrayed uneasiness.\\nJessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in\\nwhich to calm herself. Kynes had said: \" . . . the shortening of the way.\" In\\nthe old tongue, the phrase translated as \"Kwisatz Haderach.\" The planetologist\\'s\\nodd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was\\nbending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.\\nKwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that\\nlegend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the\\nKwisatz Haderach. He could be.\\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt\\'s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: \"Many\\npeople have sought to change Arrakis.\"\\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist\\nupright and away from the flirting woman.\\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his\\nthroat behind Leto, said: \"Dinner is served, my Lord.\"\\nThe Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.\\n\"The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,\"\\nShe said, and smiled; \"Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?\"\\nHe spoke coldly: \"That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for\\nnow.\"\\nThe illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought.\\nHe glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?\\nJessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently\\nthe past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. Is it\\nbecause I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how\\nimportant it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a\\nsocial plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses\\nthat fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.\\nLeto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said\\nwhen informed of the affair: \"Sire! I forbid it!\"\\nA grim smile touched the Duke\\'s mouth. What a scene that had been. And when\\nthe Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner. Hawat had shaken his\\nhead. \"I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,\" he\\'d said. \"Things move too\\nswiftly on Arrakis. That\\'s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.\"\\nPaul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than\\nhimself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young\\nwoman said.\\n\"Her father manufactures stillsuits,\" Jessica said. \"I\\'m told that only a\\nfool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man\\'s suits.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Who\\'s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?\" the Duke asked. \"I\\ndon\\'t place him.\"\\n\"A late addition to the list,\" she whispered. \"Gurney arranged the\\ninvitation. Smuggler.\"\\n\"Gurney arranged?\"\\n\"At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a\\nlittle stiff about it. The smuggler\\'s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He\\'s a power\\namong his kind. They all know him here. He\\'s dined at many of the houses.\"\\n\"Why is he here?\"\\n\"Everyone here will ask that question,\" she said. \"Tuek will sow doubt and\\nsuspicion just by his presence. He\\'ll also serve notice that you\\'re prepared to\\nback up your orders against graft--by enforcement from the smugglers\\' end as\\nwell. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.\"\\n\"I\\'m not sure I like it.\" He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of\\ntheir guests remained to precede them. \"Why didn\\'t you invite some Fremen?\"\\n\"There\\'s Kynes,\" she said.\\n\"Yes, there\\'s Kynes,\" he said. \"Have you arranged any other little surprises\\nfor me?\" He led her into step behind the procession.\\n\"All else is most conventional,\" she said.\\nAnd she thought: My darling, can\\'t you see that this smuggler controls fast\\nships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from\\nArrakis if all else fails us here.\\nAs they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto\\nto seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for\\nhim. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but\\nthe Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in\\nfootman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.\\nUneasy silence settled over the room.\\nJessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the\\ncorners of Leto\\'s mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has\\nangered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.\\n\"Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,\" Leto said. \"This is\\nmy way of telling you that many things will change.\"\\nEmbarrassed silence settled over the table.\\nThey think him drunk, Jessica thought.\\nLeto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor, lights shot\\nbeams of reflection off it. \"As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,\" he said, \"I\\ngive you a toast.\"\\nThe others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the\\nsudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from\\nthe serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke\\'s hawk features.\\n\"Here I am and here I remain!\" he barked.\\nThere was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths--stopped as the Duke\\nremained with arm upraised. \"My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our\\nhearts: \\'Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!\\' \"\\nHe sipped his water.\\nThe others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.\\n\"Gurney!\" the Duke called.\\nFrom an alcove at Leto\\'s end of the room came Halleck\\'s voice. \"Here, my\\nLord.\"\\n\"Give us a tune, Gurney.\"\\nA minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began\\nputting plates of food on the table at the Duke\\'s gesture releasing them--roast\\ndesert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with\\nmelange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true\\npot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.\\nStill, the Duke remained standing.\\n\\n\\x0cAs the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before\\nthem and the standing Duke, Leto said: \"In olden times, it was the duty of the\\nhost to entertain his guests with his own talents.\" His knuckles turned white,\\nso fiercely did he grip his water flagon. \"I cannot sing, but I give you the\\nwords of Gurney\\'s song. Consider it another toast--a toast to all who\\'ve died\\nbringing us to this station.\"\\nAn uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.\\nJessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her--there\\nwas the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank\\nrepresentative (he seemed a whistle-faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on\\nLeto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuck, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.\\n\"Review, friends--troops long past review,\" the Duke intoned. \"All to fate a\\nweight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review,\\nfriends--troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile.\\nWith them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends--troops long past review.\\nWhen our time ends on its rictus smile, we\\'ll pass the lure of fortune.\"\\nThe Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink\\nfrom his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the\\nbrim onto the linen.\\nThe others drank in embarrassed silence.\\nAgain, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining\\nhalf onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.\\nJessica was first to follow his example.\\nThere was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons.\\nJessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around\\nhim. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests\\' actions revealed-especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already\\ncast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in\\ntrembling hands, delayed reactions\\' nervous laughter . . . and violent obedience\\nto the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male\\ncompanion recovered it.\\nKynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetotogist\\nhesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He\\nsmiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her\\nin a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.\\nHalleck\\'s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor\\nkey, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.\\n\"Let the dinner commence,\" the Duke said, and sank into his chair.\\nHe\\'s angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler\\nhit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that\\nloss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to\\nhide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.\\nSlowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way.\\nThe stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.\\n\"We brought both from Caladan,\" she said.\\n\"Superb!\" he said, tasting the chukka. \"Simply superb! And not a hint of\\nmelange in it. One gets so tired of the spice in everything.\"\\nThe Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. \"I understand, Doctor\\nKynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.\"\\n\"News\\' travels fast,\" the Duke said.\\n\"Then it\\'s true?\" the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.\\n\"Of course, it\\'s true!\" the Duke snapped. \"The blasted carry-all\\ndisappeared. It shouldn\\'t be possible for anything that big to disappear!\"\\n\"When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,\" Kynes said.\\n\"It should not be possible!\" the Duke repeated.\\n\"No one saw the carryall leave?\" the banker asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,\" Kynes said. \"They\\'re\\nprimarily interested in wormsign. A carryall\\'s complement usually is four men-two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one--or even two of this crew were\\nin the pay of the Duke\\'s foes--\"\\n\"Ah-h-h, I see,\" the banker said. \"And you, as Judge of the Change, do you\\nchallenge this?\"\\n\"I shall have to consider my position carefully,\" Kynes said, \"and I\\ncertainly will not discuss it at table.\" And he thought: That pale skeleton of a\\nman! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.\\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The\\nsubject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy-faced Reverend\\nMother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the\\nsubject matter.\\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the\\nsimilar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline\\nsets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to\\nanalysis and prediction.\\n\"Now, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage\\nagents. That is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are\\nsimilar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to\\nseparate this element for your analysis--in the beginning, through interrogation\\npatterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by\\nclose observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You\\nwill find it fairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of\\ncourse, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.\"\\nNow, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing\\nthat Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was\\na Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern--subtly masked, but\\nexposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.\\nDoes this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she\\nasked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling\\nfor a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He\\nwill shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent, but with\\nominous overtones, she told herself. It\\'s his pattern.\\nThe banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by\\nthe woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table\\nwho was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.\\n\"I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,\" the banker said,\\ndirecting his words at Jessica. \"All of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers.\"\\nThe stillsuit manufacturer\\'s daughter, seated between Paul and his father at\\nthe other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: \"Oh,\\nSoo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.\"\\nThe banker smiled. \"They call me Soo-Soo because I\\'m financial adviser to\\nthe Water Peddlers Union.\" And, as Jessica continued to look at him without\\ncomment, he added: \"Because of the water-sellers\\' cry--\\'Soo-Soo Sook!\\' \" And he\\nimitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.\\nJessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young\\nwoman had spoken on cue--a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker\\nto say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate was\\nscowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had\\nsaid: \"I, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis--water.\"\\nPaul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion\\'s voice, saw that his\\nmother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse,\\nhe decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the\\nbanker.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?\"\\n\"That\\'s an odd question, young Master,\" the banker said. \"I merely said the\\nbirds drink blood. It doesn\\'t have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?\"\\n\"It was not an odd question,\" Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle\\nriposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. \"Most educated people know\\nthat the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its\\nown kind.\" He deliberately forked a bite of food from his companion\\'s plate, ate\\nit. \"They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.\"\\nThe banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.\\n\"Do not make the error of considering my son a child,\" the Duke said. And he\\nsmiled.\\nJessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both\\nKynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.\\n\"It\\'s a rule of ecology,\" Kynes said, \"that the young Master appears to\\nunderstand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for\\nthe free energy of a system. Blood\\'s an efficient energy source.\"\\nThe banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: \"It\\'s said that the\\nFremen scum drink the blood of their dead.\"\\nKynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: \"Not the blood, sir. But\\nall of a man\\'s water, ultimately, belongs to his people--to his tribe. It\\'s a\\nnecessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water\\'s precious there, and the\\nhuman body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man,\\nsurely, no longer requires that water.\"\\nThe banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica\\nthought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.\\nKynes looked at Jessica. \"Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an\\nugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed\\nclarifying.\"\\n\"You\\'ve associated so long with Fremen that you\\'ve lost all sensibilities,\"\\nthe banker rasped.\\nKynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. \"Are you\\nchallenging me, sir?\"\\nThe banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: \"Of course not. I\\'d not so\\ninsult our host and hostess.\"\\nJessica heard the fear in the man\\'s voice, saw it in his face, in his\\nbreathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!\\n\"Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when\\nthey\\'ve been insulted,\" Kynes said. \"They\\'re brave people who understand defense\\nof honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here . .\\n. now . . . on Arrakis.\"\\nJessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People\\nall around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table.\\nTwo notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker\\'s\\ndiscomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a\\ncue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.\\n\"Well?\" Kynes said.\\n\"I meant no offense,\" the banker muttered. \"If offense was taken, please\\naccept my apologies.\"\\n\"Freely given, freely accepted,\" Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed\\neating as though nothing had happened.\\nJessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man\\nhad shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes\\' assistance. There\\nexisted an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.\\nLeto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The Geologist\\'s\\nmanner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had\\nseemed colder on their trip over the desert.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared\\nwith langues de lapins de garenne--red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the\\nside.\\nSlowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in\\nit, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would\\nhave killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was\\nan offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes\\' manner. He was a casual killer, and\\nshe guessed that this was a Fremen quality.\\nJessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: \"I find\\nmyself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.\"\\n\"Very important,\" he agreed. \"What is this dish? It\\'s delicious.\"\\n\"Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,\" she said. \"A very old recipe.\"\\n\"I must have that recipe,\" the man said.\\nShe nodded. \"I\\'ll see that you get it.\"\\nKynes looked at Jessica, said: \"The newcomer to Arrakis frequently\\nunderestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the\\nLaw of the Minimum.\"\\nShe heard the testing quality in his voice, said, \"Growth is limited by that\\nnecessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the least\\nfavorable condition controls the growth rate.\"\\n\"It\\'s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological\\nproblems,\" Kynes said. \"Water is the least favorable condition for life on\\nArrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions\\nunless treated with extreme care.\"\\nJessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes\\' words, but knew she was missing\\nit. \"Growth,\" she said. \"Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water\\nto sustain human life under more favorable conditions?\"\\n\"Impossible!\" the water magnate barked.\\nJessica turned her attention to Bewt. \"Impossible?\"\\n\"Impossible on Arrakis,\" he said. \"Don\\'t listen to this dreamer. All the\\nlaboratory evidence is against him.\"\\nKynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around\\nthe table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.\\n\"Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,\" Kynes said.\\n\"That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist\\nout-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.\"\\n\"Normal!\" Bewt snorted. \"Nothing about Arrakis is normal!\"\\n\"Quite the contrary,\" Kynes said. \"Certain harmonies could be set up here\\nalong self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the\\nplanet and the pressures upon it.\"\\n\"It\\'ll never be done,\" Bewt said.\\nThe Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes\\'\\nattitude had changed--it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the\\nconservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.\\n\"What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?\"\\nLeto asked.\\n\"If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved\\nin forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we\\'ve started the cyclic system,\"\\nKynes said.\\n\"Water\\'s the only problem?\" the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes\\' excitement,\\nfelt himself caught up in it.\\n\"Water overshadows the other problems,\" Kynes said. \"This planet has much\\noxygen without its usual concomitants--widespread plant life and large sources\\nof free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual\\nchemical interchanges over large surf ace areas here.\"\\n\"Do you have pilot projects?\" the Duke asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"We\\'ve had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect--small-unit\\nexperiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its working\\nfacts.\" Kynes said.\\n\"There isn\\'t enough water,\" Bewt said. \"There just isn\\'t enough water.\"\\n\"Master Bewt is an expert on water,\" Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to\\nhis dinner.\\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: \"No! I want an\\nanswer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?\"\\nKynes stared at his plate.\\nJessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she\\nthought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.\\n\"Is there enough water?\" the Duke demanded.\\n\"There . . . maybe,\" Kynes said.\\nHe\\'s faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.\\nWith his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use\\nevery ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But\\nKynes doesn\\'t wish it to be known.\\n\"Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,\" Bewt said. \"He dreams with\\nthe Fremen--of prophecies and messiahs.\"\\nChuckles sounded at odd places around the table Jessica marked them--the\\nsmuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer\\'s daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with\\nthe mysterious escort service.\\nTensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There\\'s too\\nmuch going on of which I\\'m not aware. I\\'ll have to develop new information\\nsources.\\nThe Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let\\ndown, as though something vital had passed him here. \"May be,\" he muttered.\\nKynes spoke quickly: \"Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord.\\nThere are so many--\"\\nThe planetologist broke off as an uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in\\nthrough the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke\\'s side.\\nThe man bent, whispering into Leto\\'s ear.\\nJessica recognized the capsign of Hawat\\'s corps, fought down uneasiness. She\\naddressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer\\'s feminine companion--a tiny,\\ndark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.\\n\"You\\'ve hardly touched your dinner, my dear,\" Jessica said. \"May I order you\\nsomething?\"\\nThe woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: \"I\\'m\\nnot very hungry.\"\\nAbruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of\\ncommand: \"Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has\\narisen that requires my personal attention.\" He stepped aside. \"Paul, take over\\nas host for me, if you please.\"\\nPaul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to\\nplay this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father\\'s chair, sat down\\nin it.\\nThe Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: \"Gurney, please take\\nPaul\\'s place at table. We mustn\\'t have an odd number here. When the dinner\\'s\\nover, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call.\"\\nHalleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming\\nout of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall,\\ncrossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.\\n\"There\\'s no need for alarm,\" the Duke said, \"but I must ask that no one\\nleave until our house guard says it\\'s safe. You will be perfectly secure as long\\nas you remain here, and we\\'ll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul caught the code words in his father\\'s message--guard-safe-secure-shortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read\\nthe same message. They both relaxed.\\nThe Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door\\nfollowed by his trooper.\\nPaul said: \"Please go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was\\ndiscussing water.\"\\n\"May we discuss it another time?\" Kynes asked.\\n\"By all means,\" Paul said.\\nAnd Jessica noted with pride her son\\'s dignity, the mature sense of\\nassurance.\\nThe banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. \"None of us\\nhere can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume\\nhe aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps\\nyou\\'ve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man.\"\\nJessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a\\nhandsignal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls\\nmove into positions of maximum guard.\\nBewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.\\nPaul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards,\\nlooked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: \"Once, on\\nCaladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He--\"\\n\"Drowned?\" It was the stillsuit manufacturer\\'s daughter.\\nPaul hesitated, then: \"Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.\"\\n\"What an interesting way to die,\" she murmured.\\nPaul\\'s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. \"The\\ninteresting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders--made by\\nanother fisherman\\'s claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat--a\\ncraft for traveling on water--that foundered . . . sank beneath the water.\\nAnother fisherman helping recover the body said he\\'d seen marks like this man\\'s\\nwounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand\\non this poor fellow\\'s shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface--to\\nreach air.\"\\n\"Why is this interesting?\" the banker asked.\\n\"Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the\\ndrowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable-except when you see it happen in the drawing room.\" Paul hesitated just long\\nenough for the banker to see the point coming, then: \"And, I should add, except\\nwhen you see it at the dinner table.\"\\nA sudden stillness enfolded the room.\\nThat was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call\\nmy son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The House troopers\\nwere alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.\\n\"Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!\" It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with\\ncomplete abandon.\\nNervous smiles appeared around the table.\\nBewt was grinning.\\nThe banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.\\nKynes said: \"One baits an Atreides at his own risk.\"\\n\"Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?\" the banker demanded.\\nBefore Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: \"Sir!\" And she\\nthought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature\\'s game. Is he here to try for\\nPaul? Does he have help?\\n\"My son displays a general garment and you claim it\\'s cut to your fit?\"\\nJessica asked. \"What a fascinating revelation.\" She slid a hand down to her leg\\nto the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.\\n\\n\\x0cThe banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she\\nsaw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had\\nfocused on the code word: garment. \"Prepare for violence. \"\\nKynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to\\nTuek.\\nThe smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. \"I\\'ll give you a\\ntoast,\" he said. \"To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by\\nhis actions.\"\\nWhy do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.\\nThe banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent\\'s\\nface.\\nPeople began responding all around the table.\\nWhere Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides\\nwith Paul. What\\'s the secret of his power? It can\\'t be because he\\'s Judge of the\\nChange. That\\'s temporary. And certainly not because he\\'s a civil servant.\\nShe removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes,\\nwho responded in kind.\\nOnly Paul and the banker-- (Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica\\nthought.)--remained empty-handed. The banker\\'s attention stayed fixed on Kynes.\\nPaul stared at his plate.\\nI was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced\\ncovertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom?\\nCertainly not from that banker fellow.\\nHalleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his\\nwords over the heads of the guests across from him: \"In our society, people\\nshouldn\\'t be quick to take offense. It\\'s frequently suicidal.\" He looked at the\\nstillsuit manufacturer\\'s daughter beside him. \"Don\\'t you think so, miss?\"\\n\"Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed I do,\" She said. \"There\\'s too much violence. It makes\\nme sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It\\ndoesn\\'t make sense.\"\\n\"Indeed it doesn\\'t,\" Halleck said.\\nJessica saw the near perfection of the girl\\'s act, realized: That emptyheaded little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the\\npattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They\\nhad planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been\\nthe first to see it--his training hadn\\'t overlooked that obvious gambit.\\nKynes spoke to the banker: \"Isn\\'t another apology in order?\"\\nThe banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: \"My Lady, I fear I\\'ve\\noverindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I\\'m not\\naccustomed to it.\"\\nJessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: \"When strangers\\nmeet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training.\"\\n\"Thank you, my Lady,\" he said.\\nThe dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward\\nJessica, said: \"The Duke spoke of our being secure here. I do hope that doesn\\'t\\nmean more fighting.\"\\nShe was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.\\n\"Likely this will prove unimportant,\" Jessica said. \"But there\\'s so much\\ndetail requiring the Duke\\'s personal attention in these times. As long as enmity\\ncontinues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has\\nsworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.\" She\\nglanced at the Guild Bank agent. \"And the Conventions, naturally, support him in\\nthis.\" She shifted her attention to Kynes.\" Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?\"\\n\"Indeed it is,\" Kynes said.\\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at\\nhim, said: \"I do believe I\\'ll eat something now. I\\'d like some of that bird dish\\nyou served earlier.\"\\n\\n\\x0cJessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: \"And you, sir, were\\nspeaking of birds earlier and of their habits. I find so many interesting things\\nabout Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into\\nthe desert?\"\\n\"Oh, no, my Lady,\" he said. \"Very little\\'s known of the deep desert. And\\nalmost nothing of the southern regions.\"\\n\"There\\'s a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the\\nsouthern reaches,\" Kynes said, \"but I suspect it was an imaginative invention\\nmade solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters do, on occasion,\\npenetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that\\'s extremely dangerous-navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase dramatically\\nthe farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn\\'t been found profitable\\nto venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather satellite . . .\"\\nBewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: \"It\\'s said the Fremen\\ntravel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells even\\nin the southern latitudes.\"\\n\"Soaks and sip-wells?\" Jessica asked.\\nKynes spoke quickly: \"Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other\\nplanets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or\\nnear enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs. A\\nsip-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw . . . so\\nit is said.\"\\nThere\\'s deception in his words, Jessica thought.\\nWhy is he lying? Paul wondered.\\n\"How very interesting,\" Jessica said. And she thought. \"It is said . . .\"\\nWhat a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it\\nreveals about their dependence on superstitions.\\n\"I\\'ve heard you have a saying,\" Paul said, \"that polish comes from the\\ncities, wisdom from the desert.\"\\n\"There are many sayings on Arrakis,\" Kynes said.\\nBefore Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a\\nnote. She opened it, saw the Duke\\'s handwriting and code signs, scanned it.\\n\"You\\'ll all be delighted to know,\" she said, \"that our Duke sends his\\nreassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The missing\\ncarryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others\\nand flew the machine to a smugglers\\' base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and\\nmachine were turned over to our forces.\" She nodded to Tuek.\\nThe smuggler nodded back.\\nJessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.\\n\"I\\'m glad it didn\\'t come to open battle,\" the banker said. \"The people have\\nsuch hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.\"\\n\"Especially prosperity,\" Bewt said.\\n\"Shall we have our dessert now?\" Jessica asked. \"I\\'ve had our chef prepare a\\nCaladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.\"\\n\"It sounds wonderful,\" the stillsuit manufacturer said. \"Would it be\\npossible to get the recipe?\"\\n\"Any recipe you desire,\" Jessica said, registering the man for later mention\\nto Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be\\nbought.\\nSmall talk resumed around her: \"Such a lovely fabric . . .\" \"He is having a\\nsetting made to match the jewel . . .\" \"We might try for a production increase\\nnext quarter . . .\"\\nJessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto\\'s\\nmessage: \"The Harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns. We captured\\nthem. This may mean they\\'ve succeeded with other shipments. It certainly means\\nthey don\\'t place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions.\"\\n\\n\\x0cJessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of\\ndisruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance\\nwas not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun\\nand shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a\\ndangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the\\ngunner and his shielded target.\\nThe unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.\\nPaul said: \"I never doubted we\\'d find the carryall. Once my father moves to\\nsolve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to\\ndiscover.\"\\nHe\\'s boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn\\'t boast. No person who\\'ll be\\nsleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has\\nthe right to boast.\\n', 17: '\\n\"There is no escape--we pay for the violence of our ancestors. \"\\n-from \"The Collected Sayings of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nJessica heard the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light beside\\nher bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she\\nhad to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A.M.\\nThe disturbance was loud and incoherent.\\nIs this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.\\nShe slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family\\nwas. The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they\\'d hastily\\nconverted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn\\'t penetrating to his\\nquarters. There was no one in the Duke\\'s room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he\\nstill at the field C.P.?\\nThere were no screens yet to the front of the house.\\nJessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.\\nThere was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr.\\nYueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into\\nslippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.\\nAgain, a voice called out for Yueh.\\nJessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the\\nthought struck her: What if Leto\\'s hurt?\\nThe hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned\\nthrough the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to\\nthe Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors\\nglowing at maximum.\\nTo her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan\\nIdaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting\\nsilence to the scene.\\nOne of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: \"You see what you did?\\nYou woke the Lady Jessica.\"\\nThe great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door\\nremained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one side\\nstaring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at\\nthe hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.\\n\"So I woke the Lady Jessica,\" Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the\\nceiling, bellowed: \"My sword was firs\\' blooded on Grumman!\"\\nGreat Mother! He\\'s drunk! Jessica thought.\\nIdaho\\'s dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the\\nfur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed\\nan expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.\\nJessica crossed to him.\\n\\n\\x0cOne of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. \"We\\ndidn\\'t know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance out\\nfront, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along and see\\nhim. That wouldn\\'t do at all. Give us a bad name here.\"\\n\"Where has he been?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat\\'s\\norders.\"\\n\"Which young lady?\"\\n\"One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?\" He glanced at Mapes,\\nlowered his voice. \"They\\'re always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of\\nthe ladies.\"\\nAnd Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?\\nShe frowned, turned to Mapes. \"Mapes, bring a stimulant. I\\'d suggest\\ncaffeine. Perhaps there\\'s some of the spice coffee left.\"\\nMapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor.\\nIdaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica.\\n\"Killed more\\'n three hunner\\' men f\\'r the Duke,\" he muttered. \"Whadduh wanna know\\nis why\\'m mere? Can\\'t live unner th\\' groun\\' here. Can\\'t live onna groun\\' here.\\nWha\\' kinna place is \\'iss, huh?\"\\nA sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica\\'s attention. She turned, saw\\nYueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was fully\\ndressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his\\nforehead.\\n\"Th\\' good docker!\" Idaho shouted. \"Whad\\'re you, Doc? Splint \\'n\\' pill man?\"\\nHe turned blearily toward Jessica. \"Makin\\' uh damn fool uh m\\'self, huh?\"\\nJessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk? Was\\nhe drugged?\\n\"Too much spice beer,\" Idaho said, attempting to straighten.\\nMapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainly behind\\nYueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.\\nYueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: \"Spice\\nbeer, eh?\"\\n\"Bes\\' damn stuff ever tas\\'ed,\" Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to\\nattention. \"My sword was firs\\' blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon . . . Harkon\\n. . . killed \\'im f\\'r th\\' Duke.\"\\nYueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes\\' hand.\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\"Caffeine,\" Jessica said.\\nYueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. \"Drink this, lad.\"\\n\"Don\\'t wan\\' any more f drink.\"\\n\"Drink it, I say!\"\\nIdaho\\'s head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging\\nthe guards with him. \"I\\'m almighdy fed up with pleasin\\' th\\' \\'Mperial Universe,\\nDoc. Jus\\' once, we\\'re gonna do th\\' thing my way.\"\\n\"After you drink this,\" Yueh said. \"It\\'s just caffeine.\"\\n\" \\'Sprolly like all res\\' uh this place! Damn\\' sun \\'stoo brighd. Nothin\\' has\\nuh righd color. Ever\\'thing\\'s wrong or . . . \"\\n\"Well, it\\'s nighttime now,\" Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. \"Drink this like\\na good lad. It\\'ll make you feel better.\"\\n\"Don\\' wanna feel bedder!\"\\n\"We can\\'t argue with him all night,\" Jessica said. And she thought: This\\ncalls for shock treatment.\\n\"There\\'s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,\" Yueh said. \"I can take care of\\nthis.\"\\nJessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across\\nthe cheek.\\n\\n\\x0cHe stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.\\n\"This is no way to act in your Duke\\'s home,\" she said. She snatched the cup\\nfrom Yueh\\'s hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. \"Now drink\\nthis! That\\'s an order!\"\\nIdaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with\\ncareful and precise enunciation: \"I do not take orders from a damn\\' Harkonnen\\nspy.\"\\nYueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.\\nHer face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her--the\\nbroken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past\\nfew days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of anger almost\\ntoo great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to\\nquiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze\\nflickering.\\nThey were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!\\nShe shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.\\n\"You knew this?\" she demanded.\\n\"I . . . heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn\\'t want to add to your burdens.\"\\n\"Hawat!\" she snapped. \"I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!\"\\n\"But, my Lady . . . \"\\n\"Immediately!\"\\nIt has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no\\nother source without being discarded immediately.\\nIdaho shook his head, mumbled. \"Chuck th\\' whole damn thing.\"\\nJessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents\\nacross Idaho\\'s face. \"Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing,\" she\\nordered. \"Let him sleep it off.\"\\nThe two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: \"Perhaps we should\\ntake him someplace else, m\\'Lady. We could . . . \"\\n\"He\\'s supposed to be here!\" Jessica snapped. \"He has a job to do here.\" Her\\nvoice dripped bitterness. \"He\\'s so good at watching the ladies.\"\\nThe guard swallowed.\\n\"Do you know where the Duke is?\" she demanded.\\n\"He\\'s at the command post, my Lady.\"\\n\"Is Hawat with him?\"\\n\"Hawat\\'s in the city, my Lady.\"\\n\"You will bring Hawat to me at once,\" Jessica said. \"I will be in my sitting\\nroom when he arrives.\"\\n\"But, my Lady . . . \"\\n\"If necessary, I will call the Duke,\" she said. \"I hope it will not be\\nnecessary. I would not want to disturb him with this.\"\\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\\nJessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes\\' hands, met the questioning stare of\\nthe blue-within-blue eyes. \"You may return to bed, Mapes.\"\\n\"You\\'re sure you\\'ll not need me?\"\\nJessica smiled grimly. \"I\\'m sure.\"\\n\"Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow,\" Yueh said. \"I could give you a\\nsedative and . . . \"\\n\"You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,\" she\\nsaid. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. \"This is the only\\nway.\"\\nAbruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her\\nrooms. Cold walls . . . passages . . . a familiar door . . . She jerked the door\\nopen, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the\\nshield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the\\nHarkonnens bought? We shall see.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered\\ncover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She was\\nsuddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She removed\\nthe sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once more, she\\nglanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any\\nemergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs along the wall, the\\ntwo low tables, her stand-mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.\\nPale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat down\\nin the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair\\'s regal\\nheaviness for this occasion.\\nNow, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she\\nprepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating\\npatience, saving her strength.\\nSooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at\\nher command.\\nShe watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of\\ndrug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath. Hawat\\'s rheumy\\nold eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the room\\'s\\nlight, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm.\\nShe smelled blood there.\\nJessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: \"Bring that\\nchair and sit facing me.\"\\nHawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He studied\\nJessica\\'s face, wondering how he could save this situation.\\n\"It\\'s long past time to clear the air between us,\" Jessica said.\\n\"What troubles my Lady?\" He sat down, placed hands on knees.\\n\"Don\\'t play coy with me!\" she snapped. \"If Yueh didn\\'t tell you why I\\nsummoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at least\\nthat honest with each other?\"\\n\"As you wish, my Lady.\"\\n\"First, you will answer me one question,\" she said. \"Are you now a Harkonnen\\nagent?\"\\nHawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: \"You\\ndare insult me so?\"\\n\"Sit down,\" she said. \"You insulted me so.\"\\nSlowly, he sank back into the chair.\\nAnd Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed\\nherself a deep breath. It isn\\'t Hawat.\\n\"Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke,\" she said. \"I\\'m prepared,\\ntherefore, to forgive your affront to me.\"\\n\"Is there something to forgive?\"\\nJessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the\\nDuke\\'s daughter I\\'ve carried within me these few weeks? No . . . Leto himself\\ndoesn\\'t know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when he\\nmust concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.\\n\"A Truthsayer would solve this,\" she said, \"but we have no Truthsayer\\nqualified by the High Board.\"\\n\"As you say. We\\'ve no Truthsayer.\"\\n\"Is there a traitor among us?\" she asked. \"I\\'ve studied our people with\\ngreat care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their lieutenants\\nare not strategically enough placed to consider. It\\'s not you, Thufir. It cannot\\nbe Paul. I know it\\'s not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him in and put him to\\nthe test?\"\\n\"You know that\\'s an empty gesture,\" Hawat said. \"He\\'s conditioned by the\\nHigh College. That I know for certain.\"\\n\"Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens,\"\\nJessica said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"So that\\'s what happened to her,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Haven\\'t you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?\"\\n\"You know I don\\'t have the ear,\" Hawat said.\\n\"What brought this base suspicion on me?\" she asked.\\nHawat frowned. \"My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first\\nloyalty is to the Duke.\"\\n\"I\\'m prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,\" she said.\\n\"And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?\"\\n\"Stalemate?\" she asked.\\nHe shrugged.\\n\"Let us discuss something else for a minute, then,\" she said. \"Duncan Idaho,\\nthe admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so\\nesteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer. I hear\\nreports that others among our people have been stupefied by this concoction. Is\\nthat true?\"\\n\"You have your reports, my Lady.\"\\n\"So I do. Don\\'t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?\"\\n\"My Lady speaks riddles.\"\\n\"Apply your Mentat abilities to it!\" she snapped. \"What\\'s the problem with\\nDuncan and the others? I can tell you in four words--they have no home.\"\\nHe jabbed a finger at the floor. \"Arrakis, that\\'s their home.\"\\n\"Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we\\'ve uprooted them.\\nThey have no home. And they fear the Duke\\'s failing them.\"\\nHe stiffened. \"Such talk from one of the men would be cause for--\"\\n\"Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to\\ndiagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.\"\\n\"The Duke gives me charge over such matters.\"\\n\"But you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress of\\nthis disease,\" she said. \"And perhaps you\\'ll grant I have certain abilities\\nalong these lines.\"\\nWill I have to shock him severely? she wondered. He needs shaking up-something to break him from routine.\\n\"There could be many interpretations for your concern,\" Hawat said. He\\nshrugged.\\n\"Then you\\'ve already convicted me?\"\\n\"Of course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take any chances, the\\nsituation being what it is.\"\\n\"A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,\" she said. \"Who\\ntook that chance?\"\\nHis face darkened. \"I offered my resignation to the Duke.\"\\n\"Did you offer your resignation to me . . . or to Paul?\"\\nNow he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation\\nof nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.\\n\"I\\'m the Duke\\'s man,\" he said, biting off the words.\\n\"There is no traitor,\" she said. \"The threat\\'s something else. Perhaps it\\nhas to do with the lasguns. Perhaps they\\'ll risk secreting a few lasguns with\\ntiming mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they\\'ll . . . \"\\n\"And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn\\'t atomic?\" he\\nasked. \"No, my Lady. They\\'ll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers.\\nThe evidence is hard to erase. No. They\\'ll observe most of the forms. It has to\\nbe a traitor.\"\\n\"You\\'re the Duke\\'s man,\" she sneered. \"Would you destroy him in the effort\\nto save him?\"\\nHe took a deep breath, then: \"If you\\'re innocent, you\\'ll have my most abject\\napologies.\"\\n\"Look at you now, Thufir,\" she said. \"Humans live best when each has his own\\nplace, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things. Destroy the\\n\\n\\x0cplace and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those who love the Duke,\\nare most ideally situated to destroy the other\\'s place. Could I not whisper\\nsuspicions about you into the Duke\\'s ear at night? When would he be most\\nsusceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?\"\\n\"You threaten me?\" he growled.\\n\"Indeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through\\nthe basic arrangement of our lives. It\\'s clever, diabolical. I propose to negate\\nthis attack by so ordering our lives that there\\'ll be no chinks for such barbs\\nto enter.\"\\n\"You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?\"\\n\"Baseless, yes.\"\\n\"You\\'d meet this with your own whispers?\"\\n\"Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.\"\\n\"Then you question my abilities?\"\\nShe sighed. \"Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotional involvement in\\nthis. The natural human\\'s an animal without logic. Your projections of logic\\nonto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for its usefulness.\\nYou\\'re the embodiment of logic--a Mentat. Yet, your problem solutions are\\nconcepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself, there to be\\nstudied and rolled around, examined from all sides.\"\\n\"You think now to teach me my trade?\" he asked, and he did not try to hide\\nthe disdain in his voice.\\n\"Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,\"\\nshe said. \"But it\\'s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems,\\nthose things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our\\nlogic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual,\\ndeep-seated thing that\\'s really chewing on us.\"\\n\"You\\'re deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a\\nMentat,\" he rasped. \"Were I to find one of our people attempting thus to\\nsabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce and\\ndestroy him.\"\\n\"The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their\\ncomputations,\" she said.\\n\"I\\'ve never said otherwise!\"\\n\"Then apply yourself to these symptoms we\\'ve both seen: drunkenness among\\nthe men, quarrels--they gossip and exchange wild rumors about Arrakis; they\\nignore the most simple--\"\\n\"Idleness, no more,\" he said. \"Don\\'t try to divert my attention by trying to\\nmake a simple matter appear mysterious.\"\\nShe stared at him, thinking of the Duke\\'s men rubbing their woes together in\\nthe barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt\\ninsulation. They\\'re becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, she thought:\\nLike the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros--sick at their guns--forever\\nseeking, forever prepared and forever unready.\\n\"Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the\\nDuke?\" she asked. \"Do you fear a rival for your position?\"\\nHe glared at her, the old eyes blazing. \"I know some of the training they\\ngive you Bene Gesserit . . . \" He broke off, scowling.\\n\"Go ahead, say it,\" she said. \"Bene Gesserit witches.\"\\n\"I know something of the real training they give you,\" he said. \"I\\'ve seen\\nit come out in Paul. I\\'m not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you\\nexist only to serve.\"\\nThe shock must be severe and he\\'s almost ready for it, she thought.\\n\"You listen respectfully to me in Council,\" she said, \"yet you seldom heed\\nmy advice. Why?\"\\n\"I don\\'t trust your Bene Gesserit motives,\" he said. \"You may think you can\\nlook through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what you--\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"You poor fool, Thufir!\" she raged.\\nHe scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.\\n\"Whatever rumors you\\'ve heard about our schools,\" she said, \"the truth is\\nfar greater. If I wished to destroy the Duke . . . or you, or any other person\\nwithin my reach, you could not stop me.\"\\nAnd she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is not\\nthe way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.\\nHawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of\\npoison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. Is this just a brag she makes? I\\ncould slay her now . . . but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I\\'m wrong.\\nJessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: \"Let us pray violence shall\\nnever be necessary between us.\"\\n\"A worthy prayer,\" he agreed.\\n\"Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us,\" she said. \"I must ask you again:\\nIsn\\'t it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this suspicion\\nto pit the two of us against each other?\"\\n\"We appear to\\'ve returned to stalemate,\" he said.\\nShe sighed, thinking: He\\'s almost ready for it.\\n\"The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people,\" she said.\\n\"The position--\"\\n\"He hasn\\'t married you,\" Hawat said.\\nShe forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.\\n\"But he\\'ll not marry anyone else,\" she said. \"Not as long as I live. And we\\nare surrogates, as I\\'ve said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, to\\ndisturb, disrupt, and confuse us--which target offers itself most enticingly to\\nthe Harkonnens?\"\\nHe sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a\\nlowering scowl.\\n\"The Duke?\" she asked. \"Attractive target, yes, but no one with the possible\\nexception of Paul is better guarded. Me? I tempt them, surely, but they must\\nknow the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there\\'s a better target, one\\nwhose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One to whom suspicion\\nis as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life on innuendo and\\nmystery.\" She darted her right hand toward him. \"You!\"\\nHawat started to leap from his chair.\\n\"I have not dismissed you, Thufir!\" she flared.\\nThe old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles\\nbetray him.\\nShe smiled without mirth.\\n\"Now you know something of the real training they give us,\" she said.\\nHawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her command had been regal,\\npreemptory--uttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible.\\nHis body had obeyed her before he could think about it. Nothing could have\\nprevented his response--not logic, not passionate anger . . . nothing. To do\\nwhat she had done spoke of a sensitive, intimate knowledge of the person thus\\ncommanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible.\\n\"I have said to you before that we should understand each other,\" she said.\\n\"I meant you should understand me. I already understand you. And I tell you now\\nthat your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me.\"\\nHe stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue.\\n\"If I desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me,\" she said. \"He might even\\nthink he did it of his own free will.\"\\nHawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes. Only the\\nmost rigid control kept him from calling the guard. Control . . . and the\\nsuspicion now that woman might not permit it. His skin crawled with the memory\\nof how she had controlled him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn\\na weapon and killed him!\\n\\n\\x0cDoes every human have this blind spot? he wondered. Can any of us be ordered\\ninto action before he can resist? The idea staggered him. Who could stop a\\nperson with such power?\\n\"You\\'ve glimpsed the fist within the Bene Gesserit glove,\" she said. \"Few\\nglimpse it and live. And what I did was a relatively simple thing for us. You\\'ve\\nnot seen my entire arsenal. Think on that,\"\\n\"Why aren\\'t you out destroying the Duke\\'s enemies?\" he asked.\\n\"What would you have me destroy?\" she asked. \"Would you have me make a\\nweakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?\"\\n\"But, with such power . . . \"\\n\"Power\\'s a two-edged sword, Thufir,\" she said; \"You think: \\'How easy for her\\nto shape a human tool to thrust into an enemy\\'s vitals.\\' True, Thufir; even into\\nyour vitals. Yet, what would I accomplish? If enough of us Bene Gesserit did\\nthis, wouldn\\'t it make all Bene Gesserit suspect? We don\\'t want that, Thufir. We\\ndo not wish to destroy ourselves.\" She nodded. \"We truly exist only to serve.\"\\n\"I cannot answer you,\" he said. \"You know I cannot answer.\"\\n\"You\\'ll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone,\" she said. \"I\\nknow you, Thufir.\"\\n\"My Lady . . . \" Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.\\nAnd he thought: She has great powers, yes. But would these not make her an\\neven more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?\\n\"The Duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies,\"\\nshe said. \"I trust now you\\'ll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove\\nit.\"\\n\"If it proves baseless,\" he said.\\n\"If,\" she sneered.\\n\"If,\" he said.\\n\"You are tenacious,\" she said.\\n\"Cautious,\" he said, \"and aware of the error factor.\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll pose another question for you: What does it mean to you that you\\nstand before another human, that you are bound and helpless and the other human\\nholds a knife at your throat--yet this other human refrains from killing you,\\nfrees you from your bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?\"\\nShe lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him. \"You may go\\nnow, Thufir.\"\\nThe old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon\\nbeneath his tunic. He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Duke\\'s father\\n(who\\'d been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida\\nlong ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and\\nconfused. The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns, cape thrown\\nflamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down from the stands.\\nI am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thought. He withdrew his hand from\\nthe weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.\\nAnd he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never\\nforget this moment nor lose this sense of supreme admiration for the Lady\\nJessica.\\nQuietly, he turned and left the room.\\nJessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and\\nstared at the closed door.\\n\"Now we\\'ll see some proper action,\" she whispered.\\n', 18: '\\nDo you wrestle with dreams?\\nDo you contend with shadows?\\nDo you move in a kind of sleep?\\nTime has slipped away.\\n\\n\\x0cYour life is stolen.\\nYou tarried with trifles,\\nVictim of your folly.\\n-Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain, from \"Songs of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess\\nIrulan\\nLeto stood in the foyer of his house, studying a note by the light of a\\nsingle suspensor lamp. Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness.\\nA Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke\\narrived from his command post.\\nThe note read: \"A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.\"\\nThere was no signature.\\nWhat does it mean? he wondered.\\nThe messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be\\nquestioned. He had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.\\nLeto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat\\nlater. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath. The\\nanti-fatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had been a long two days\\nsince the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.\\nOn top of all the military problems, there\\'d been the disquieting session\\nwith Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.\\nShould I waken Jessica? he wondered. There\\'s no reason to play the secrecy\\ngame with her any longer. Or is there?\\nBlast and damn that Duncan Idaho!\\nHe shook his head. No, not Duncan. I was wrong not to take Jessica into my\\nconfidence from the first. I must do it now, before more damage is done.\\nThe decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the\\nGreat Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.\\nAt the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A\\nstrange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put his left\\nhand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand.\\nThe knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange sound had sent a chill\\nthrough him.\\nSoftly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate\\nillumination. The smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight meters\\napart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone walls\\nswallowed the light.\\nA dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.\\nLeto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that\\nwould limit his movements, his hearing . . . and because the captured shipment\\nof lasguns had left him filled with doubts.\\nSilently, he moved toward the grey blob, saw that it was a human figure, a\\nman face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent\\nclose in the dim light to see the face. It was the smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain\\ndown his chest. The dead eyes stared with empty darkness. Leto touched the\\nstain--warm.\\nHow could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?\\nThe mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side\\npassage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator\\nfor the house.\\nHand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke skirted the body, slipped down\\nthe passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.\\nAnother grey blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at\\nonce this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward him with painful\\nslowness, gasping, mumbling.\\nLeto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage,\\ncrouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the Fremen housekeeper, her\\n\\n\\x0chair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A dull shininess of dark\\nstain spread from her back along her side. He touched her shoulder and she\\nlifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes blackshadowed emptiness.\\n\"S\\'you,\" she gasped. \"Killed . . . guard . . . sent . . . get . . . Tuek . .\\n. escape . . . m\\'Lady . . . you . . . you . . . here . . . no . . . \" She\\nflopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.\\nLeto felt for pulse at the temples. There was none. He looked at the stain:\\nshe\\'d been stabbed in the back. Who? His mind raced. Did she mean someone had\\nkilled a guard? And Tuek--had Jessica sent for him? Why?\\nHe started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand toward\\nthe shield switch--too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm aside. He felt pain\\nthere, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it\\nup his arm. It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the\\npassage.\\nYueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected yellow\\nfrom the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door. There was\\nstillness from the room behind him--no sound of generators.\\nYueh! Leto thought. He\\'s sabotaged the house generators! We \\'re wide open!\\nYueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.\\nLeto found he could still speak, gasped: \"Yueh! How?\" Then the paralysis\\nreached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the\\nstone wall.\\nYueh\\'s face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto\\'s\\nforehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote . . . dull.\\n\"The drug on the dart is selective,\" Yueh said \"You can speak, but I\\'d\\nadvise against it.\" He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled\\nout the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the dart clattering on the stones\\nwas faint and distant to the Duke\\'s ears.\\nIt can\\'t be Yueh, Leto thought. He\\'s conditioned.\\n\"How?\" Leto whispered.\\n\"I\\'m sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater\\ndemands than this.\" He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead. \"I find it\\nvery strange, myself--an override on my pyretic conscience--but I wish to kill a\\nman. Yes, I actually wish it. I will stop at nothing to do it.\"\\nHe looked down at the Duke. \"Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron Harkonnen.\\nI wish to kill the Baron.\"\\n\"Bar . . . on Har . . . \"\\n\"Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven\\'t much time. That peg tooth I put\\nin your mouth after the tumble at Narcal--that tooth must be replaced, in a\\nmoment, I\\'ll render you unconscious and replace that tooth.\" He opened his hand,\\nstared at something in it. \"An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely\\nlike a nerve. It\\'ll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you\\nbite down hard on it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your breath\\nsharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas--most deadly.\"\\nLeto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man\\'s eyes, the perspiration\\nalong brown and chin.\\n\"You were dead anyway, my poor Duke,\" Yueh said. \"But you will get close to\\nthe Baron before you die. He\\'ll believe you\\'re stupefied by drugs beyond any\\ndying effort to attack him. And you will be drugged--and tied. But attack can\\ntake strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth, Duke Leto\\nAtreides. You will remember the tooth.\"\\nThe old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache\\ndominated Leto\\'s narrowing vision.\\n\"The tooth,\" Yueh muttered.\\n\"Why?\" Leto whispered.\\n\\n\\x0cYueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. \"I made a shaitan\\'s\\nbargain with the Baron. And I must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it.\\nWhen I see him, I\\'ll know. When I look at the Baron, then I will know. But I\\'ll\\nnever enter his presence without the price. You\\'re the price, my poor Duke. And\\nI\\'ll know when I see him. My poor Wanna taught me many things, and one is to see\\ncertainty of truth when the stress is great. I cannot do it always, but when I\\nsee the Baron--then, I will know.\"\\nLeto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh\\'s hand. He felt this was\\nhappening in a nightmare--it could not be.\\nYueh\\'s purple lips turned up in a grimace. \"I\\'ll not get close enough to the\\nBaron, or I\\'d do this myself. No. I\\'ll be detained at a safe distance. But you .\\n. . ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He\\'ll want you close to him--to gloat over\\nyou, to boast a little.\"\\nLeto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yueh\\'s\\njaw. The muscle twisted when the man spoke.\\nYueh leaned closer. \"And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must\\nremember this tooth.\" He held it up between thumb and forefinger. \"It will be\\nall that remains to you.\"\\nLeto\\'s mouth moved without sound, then: \"Refuse.\"\\n\"Ah-h, no! You mustn\\'t refuse. Because, in return for this small service.\\nI\\'m doing a thing for you. I will save your son and your woman. No other can do\\nit. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.\"\\n\"How . . . save . . . them?\" Leto whispered.\\n\"By making it appear they\\'re dead, by secreting them among people who draw\\nknife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they\\'ll\\nburn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a\\nHarkonnen has walked.\" He touched Leto\\'s jaw. \"Can you feel anything in your\\njaw?\"\\nThe Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw\\nYueh\\'s hand come up with the ducal signet ring.\\n\"For Paul,\" Yueh said. \"You\\'ll be unconscious presently. Good-by, my poor\\nDuke. When next we meet we\\'ll have no time for conversation.\"\\nCool remoteness spread upward from Leto\\'s jaw, across his cheeks. The\\nshadowy, hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh\\'s purple lips centered in it.\\n\"Remember the tooth!\" Yueh hissed. \"The tooth!\"\\n', 19: '\\nThere should be a science of discontent.

Skin raspings\\nof fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light,\\nbut something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt . . . strange.\\nLump-lump-lump-lump!\\nIt was a dull sound, directionless in the dark.

She relaxed against the cold floor,\\ntesting her body\\'s readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through\\nher eyelids.\\nFeet approached: someone standing over her.\\n\"You are awake,\" rumbled a basso voice. \"Do not pretend.\"\\nShe opened her eyes.\\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized the\\ncellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side--empty. Suspensor\\nlamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a\\nglare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.\\nShe looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his\\nportable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spiderblack eyes.\\n\"The drug was timed,\" he rumbled. \"We knew to the minute when you\\'d be\\ncoming out of it.\"\\nHow could that be? she wondered. They \\'d have to know my exact weight, my\\nmetabolism, my . . . Yueh!\\n\"Such a pity you must remain gagged,\" the Baron said. \"We could have such an\\ninteresting conversation.\"\\nYueh\\'s the only one it could be, she thought. How?\\nThe Baron glanced behind him at the door. \"Come in, Piter.\"\\nShe had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but\\nthe face was known--and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She\\nstudied him--hawk features, blue-ink eyes that suggested he was a native of\\nArrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his\\nflesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something\\nabout him suggested effeminacy.\\n\"Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica.\" the\\nBaron said. \"However, I\\'m aware of your abilities.\" He glanced at the Mentat.\\n\"Isn\\'t that true, Piter?\"\\n\"As you say, Baron,\" the man said.\\n\\n\\x0cThe voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had\\nnever heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the\\nvoice screamed: Killer!\\n\"I have a surprise for Piter,\" the Baron said. \"He thinks he has come here\\nto collect his reward--you, Lady Jessica. But I wish to demonstrate a thing:\\nthat he does not really want you.\"\\n\"You play with me, Baron?\" Piter asked, and he smiled.\\nSeeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend\\nhimself from this Piter. Then she corrected herself. The Baron could not read\\nthat smile. He did not have the Training.\\n\"In many ways, Piter is quite naive,\" the Baron said. \"He doesn\\'t admit to\\nhimself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I\\'d show him, but it\\'d be\\na foolish risk.\" The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting\\nmask. \"I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power.\"\\n\"You promised I could have her,\" Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some\\nof its cold reserve.\\nJessica heard the clue-tones in the man\\'s voice, allowed herself an inward\\nshudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?\\n\"I give you a choice, Piter,\" the Baron said.\\n\"What choice?\"\\nThe Baron snapped fat fingers. \"This woman and exile from the Imperium, or\\nthe Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.\"\\nJessica watched the Baron\\'s spider eyes study Piter.\\n\"You could be Duke here in all but name,\" the Baron said.\\nIs my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin\\nsomewhere in her mind.\\nThe Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. \"Understand yourself, Piter. You\\nwant her because she was a Duke\\'s woman, a symbol of his power--beautiful,\\nuseful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That\\'s\\nmore than a symbol; that\\'s the reality. With it you could have many women . . .\\nand more.\"\\n\"You do not joke with Piter?\"\\nThe Baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him. \"Joke?\\nI? Remember--I am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the\\nlad\\'s training. They are alike, this mother and son--deadly.\" The Baron smiled.\\n\"I must go now. I will send in the guard I\\'ve reserved for this moment. He\\'s\\nstone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey\\ninto exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He\\'ll\\nnot permit you to untie her gag until you\\'re off Arrakis. If you choose not to\\nleave . . . he has other orders.\"\\n\"You don\\'t have to leave,\" Piter said. \"I\\'ve chosen.\"\\n\"Ah, hah!\" the Baron chortled. \"Such quick decision can mean only one\\nthing.\"\\n\"I will take the duchy,\" Piter said.\\nAnd Jessica thought: Doesn\\'t Piter know the Baron\\'s lying to him? But--how\\ncould he know? He\\'s a twisted Mentat.\\nThe Baron glanced down at Jessica. \"Is it not wonderful that I know Piter so\\nwell? I wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter\\'s choice. Hah!\\nWell, I leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady\\nJessica? I hold no rancor toward you. It\\'s a necessity. Much better this way.\\nYes. And I\\'ve not actually ordered you destroyed. When it\\'s asked of me what\\nhappened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth.\"\\n\"You leave it to me then?\" Piter asked.\\n\"The guard I send you will take your orders,\" the Baron said. \"Whatever\\'s\\ndone I leave to you.\" He stared at Piter. \"Yes. There will be no blood on my\\nhands here. It\\'s your decision. Yes. I know nothing of it. You will wait until\\n\\n\\x0cI\\'ve gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well . . . ah, yes. Yes.\\nGood.\"\\nHe fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the\\nReverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions,\\nthen the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah-h-h-h, my poor Leto.\\nWith one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She\\nfollowed him with her eyes, thinking: It\\'s as the Reverend Mother warned--too\\npotent an adversary.\\nTwo Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed\\nand stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.\\nThe deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron knows I\\ncould use the Voice on any other man.\\nScarface looked at Piter. \"We\\'ve the boy on a litter outside. What are your\\norders?\"\\nPiter spoke to Jessica. \"I\\'d thought of binding you by a threat held over\\nyour son, but I begin to see that would not have worked, I let emotion cloud\\nreason. Bad policy for a Mentat.\" He looked at the first pair of troopers,\\nturning so the deaf one could read his lips: \"Take them into the desert as the\\ntraitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy\\nall evidence. Their bodies must never be found.\"\\n\"You don\\'t wish to dispatch them yourself?\" Scarface asked.\\nHe reads lips, Jessica thought.\\n\"I follow my Baron\\'s example,\" Piter said. \"Take them where the traitor\\nsaid.\"\\nJessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter\\'s voice, thought: He, too,\\nfears the Truthsayer.\\nPiter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there,\\nand Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out\\nwithout turning.\\n\"Me, I wouldn\\'t like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this\\nnight\\'s work,\" Scarface said.\\n\"You ain\\'t likely ever to run into that old witch,\" one of the other\\ntroopers said. He went around to Jessica\\'s head, bent over her. \"It ain\\'t\\ngetting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and--\"\\n\"Why\\'n\\'t we kill \\'em here?\" Scarface asked.\\n\"Too messy,\" the first one said. \"Unless you wants to strangle\\'em. Me, I\\nlikes a nice straightforward job. Drop \\'em on the desert like that traitor said,\\ncut \\'em once or twice, leave \\'the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up\\nafterwards.\"\\n\"Yeah . . . well, I guess you\\'re right,\" Scarface said.\\nJessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her\\nVoice, and there was the deaf one to consider.\\nScarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of\\ngrain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor-buoyed\\nlitter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter,\\nshe saw her companion\\'s face--Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was\\nno more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.\\nIs he drugged? she wondered.\\nThe troopers lifted the litter, and Paul\\'s eyes opened the smallest\\nfraction--dark slits staring at her.\\nHe mustn\\'t try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!\\nPaul\\'s eyes closed.\\nHe had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening\\nto their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair.\\nThe mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him\\npoised, ready to expand any opportunity.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother\\'s face. She\\nappeared unharmed. Gagged, though.\\nHe wondered who could\\'ve captured her. His own captivity was plain enough-to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this\\nlitter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was\\nYueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it--a\\nSuk doctor a traitor.\\nThe litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a\\ndoorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then\\nthey were on sand, feet grating in it. A \\'thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting\\nthe stars. The litter settled to the ground.\\nPaul\\'s eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as\\nthe man who opened the \\'thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom\\nilluminated by the instrument panel.\\n\"This the \\'thopter we\\'re supposed to use?\" he asked, and turned to watch his\\ncompanion\\'s lips.\\n\"It\\'s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,\" the other said.\\nScarface nodded. \"But it\\'s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain\\'t room in\\nthere for more\\'n them an\\' two of us.\"\\n\"Two\\'s enough,\" said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his\\nlips for reading. \"We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.\"\\n\"The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two,\" Scarface\\nsaid.\\n\"What you so worried about?\" asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer.\\n\"She is a Bene Gesserit witch,\" the deaf one said. \"They have powers.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h . . . \"The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. \"One\\nof them, eh? Know whatcha mean.\"\\nThe trooper behind him grunted. \"She\\'ll be worm meat soon enough. Don\\'t\\nsuppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh,\\nCzigo?\" He nudged the litter-bearer.\\n\"Yee-up,\" the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica\\'s\\nshoulders. \"C\\'mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what\\nhappens.\"\\n\"It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,\" Scarface said.\\nJessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning--stars. She was pushed\\ninto the rear of the \\'thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she\\nwas strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she\\nnoted his bonds were simple rope.\\nScarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The\\nlitter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front\\nseat.\\nKinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The \\'thopter took off in a\\nwing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his\\ncompanion\\'s shoulder, said: \"Whyn\\'t you turn around and keep an eye on them\\ntwo?\"\\n\"Sure you know the way to go?\" Kinet watched Czigo\\'s lips.\\n\"I listened to the traitor same\\'s you.\"\\nKinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in\\nhis hand. The \\'thopter\\'s light-walled interior seemed to collect illumination as\\nher eyes adjusted, but the guard\\'s scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her\\nseat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm,\\nrealized the strap had been almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk.\\nHas someone been at this \\'thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who?\\nSlowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul\\'s.\\n\"Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this,\" Scarface\\nsaid. \"You ever have any highborn types?\" He turned to look at the pilot.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Bene Gesserit ain\\'t all highborn,\" the pilot said.\\n\"But they all looks heighty.\"\\nHe can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up\\nonto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.\\n\"Real pretty, she is,\" Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. \"Sure do\\nseem a shame.\" He looked at Czigo.\\n\"You thinking what I think you\\'re thinking?\" the pilot asked.\\n\"Who\\'d be to know?\" the guard asked. \"Afterwards . . . \" He shrugged. \"I\\njust never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again.\"\\n\"You lay a hand on my mother . . . \" Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.\\n\"Hey!\" the pilot laughed. \"Cub\\'s got a bark. Ain\\'t got no bite, though.\"\\nAnd Jessica thought; Paul\\'s pitching his voice too high. It may work,\\nthough.\\nThey flew on in silence.\\nThese poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the\\nBaron\\'s words. They\\'ll be killed as soon as they report success on their\\nmission. The Baron wants no witnesses.\\nThe \\'thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica\\nsaw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.\\n\"This oughta be far enough,\" the pilot said. \"The traitor said to put\\'em on\\nthe sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.\" He dipped the craft toward the dunes in\\na long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.\\nJessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise.\\nHe closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn\\'t\\nmastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails . . .\\nThe \\'thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back\\nacross the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.\\nSomeone\\'s following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to\\nwatch this pair. And there\\'ll be watchers for the watchers, too.\\nCzigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.\\nJessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim\\nglow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert.\\nSandblast ridges streaked its sides.\\nPaul cleared his throat.\\nThe pilot said: \"Now, Kinet?\"\\n\"I dunno, Czigo.\"\\nCzigo turned, said: \"Ah-h-h, look.\" He reached out for Jessica\\'s skirt.\\n\"Remove her gag,\" Paul commanded.\\nJessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent-imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it\\ncould still fall within this man\\'s spectrum.\\nCzigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica\\'s mouth, slipped the\\nknot on the gag.\\n\"Stop that!\" Kinet ordered.\\n\"Ah, shut your trap,\" Czigo said. \"Her hands\\'re tied.\" He freed the knot and\\nthe binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.\\nKinet put a hand on the pilot\\'s arm. \"Look, Czigo, no need to . . . \"\\nJessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low,\\nintimate tones. \"Gentlemen! No need to fight over me.\" At the same time, she\\nwrithed sinuously for Kinet\\'s benefit.\\nShe saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of\\nthe need to fight over her. Their disagreement required no other reason. In\\ntheir minds, they were fighting over her.\\nShe held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read\\nher lips, said: \"You mustn\\'t disagree.\" They drew farther apart, glanced warily\\nat each other. \"Is any woman worth fighting over?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\x0cBy uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth\\ntheir fighting.\\nPaul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had\\nbeen the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now--everything depended\\non his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.\\n\"Yeah,\" Scarface said. \"No need to fight over . . . \"\\nHis hand flashed toward the pilot\\'s neck. The blow was met by a splash of\\nmetal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet\\'s chest.\\nScarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.\\n\"Thought I was some dummy didn\\'t know that trick,\" Czigo said. He brought\\nback his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\\n\"Now for the cub,\" he said and leaned toward Paul.\\n\"No need for that,\" Jessica murmured.\\nCzigo hesitated.\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you rather have me cooperative?\" Jessica asked. \"Give the boy a\\nchance.\" Her lip curled in a sneer. \"Little enough chance he\\'d have out there in\\nthat sand. Give him that and . . . \" She smiled. \"You could find yourself well\\nrewarded.\"\\nCzigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. \"I\\'ve heard me\\nwhat can happen to a man in this desert,\" he said. \"Boy might find the knife a\\nkindness.\"\\n\"Is it so much I ask?\" Jessica pleaded.\\n\"You\\'re trying to trick me,\" Czigo muttered.\\n\"I don\\'t want to see my son die,\" Jessica said. \"Is that a trick?\"\\nCzigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him\\nacross the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. \"What\\'ll\\ny\\' do, cub, if I cut y\\'r bonds?\"\\n\"He\\'ll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,\" Jessica said.\\n\"Is that what y\\'ll do, cub?\" Czigo asked.\\nPaul\\'s voice was properly surly. \"Yes.\"\\nThe knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand\\non his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the\\ndoorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his\\nright foot.\\nThe toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of\\ntraining, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every\\nmuscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft\\npart of Czigo\\'s abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible\\nforce over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of\\nthe man\\'s heart.\\nWith one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul,\\nunable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing with a roll\\nthat took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove\\nback into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother\\nsawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.\\n\"I could\\'ve handled him,\" she said. \"He\\'d have had to cut my bindings. That\\nwas a foolish risk.\"\\n\"I saw the opening and used it,\" he said.\\nShe heard the harsh control in his voice, said: \"Yueh\\'s house sign is\\nscrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.\"\\nHe looked up, saw the curling symbol.\\n\"Get out and let us study this craft,\" she said. \"There\\'s a bundle under the\\npilot\\'s seat. I felt it when we got in.\"\\n\"Bomb?\"\\n\"Doubt it. There\\'s something peculiar here.\"\\nPaul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under\\nthe seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo\\'s feet close to her face, feeling\\n\\n\\x0cdampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot\\'s\\nblood.\\nWaste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.\\nPaul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a\\nbeach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his\\nmother lifted the bundle from the \\'thopter, saw her stare across the dunes\\ntoward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another\\n\\'thopter swooping toward them, realized they\\'d not have time to clear the bodies\\nout of this \\'thopter and escape.\\n\"Run, Paul!\" Jessica shouted. \"It\\'s Harkonnens!\"\\n', 20: '\\nArrakis teaches the attitude of the knife--chopping off what\\'s incomplete and\\nsaying: \"Now, it\\'s complete because it\\'s ended here.\"\\n-from \"Collected Sayings of, Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nA man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared\\nin at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes\\' body, the sprawled form of the\\nDuke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a\\ncasual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a\\nshiver through Yueh.\\nSardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the\\nEmperor\\'s own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform,\\nthere\\'s no disguising them.\\n\"You\\'re Yueh,\" the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring\\non the Doctor\\'s hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh\\'s\\neyes.\\n\"I am Yueh,\" the Doctor said.\\n\"You can relax, Yueh,\" the man said. \"When you dropped the house shields we\\ncame right in. Everything\\'s under control here. Is this the Duke?\"\\n\"This is the Duke.\"\\n\"Dead?\"\\n\"Merely unconscious. I suggest you tie him.\"\\n\"Did you do for these others?\" He glanced back down the hall where Mapes\\'\\nbody lay.\\n\"More\\'s the pity,\" Yueh muttered.\\n\"Pity!\" the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto. \"So that\\'s\\nthe great Red Duke.\"\\nIf I had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought.\\nOnly the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Duke.\\nThe Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto\\'s uniform.\\n\"Little souvenir,\" he said. \"Where\\'s the ducal signet ring?\"\\n\"He doesn\\'t have it on him,\" Yueh said.\\n\"I can see that!\" the Sardaukar snapped.\\nYueh stiffened, swallowed, if they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they\\'ll\\nfind out about the ring, about the \\'thopter I prepared--all will fail.\\n\"Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order\\ncame directly from him,\" Yueh said.\\n\"Must be damned trusted messengers,\" the Sardaukar muttered.\\n\"Aren\\'t you going to tie him?\" Yueh ventured.\\n\"How long\\'ll he be unconscious?\"\\n\"Two hours or so. I wasn\\'t as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman\\nand boy.\"\\nThe Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. \"This was nothing to fear even\\nwhen awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?\"\\n\"About ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"So soon?\"\\n\"I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.\"\\n\"So he will. You\\'ll wait outside, Yueh.\" He shot a hard glance at Yueh.\\n\"Now!\"\\nYueh glanced at Leto. \"What about . . . \"\\n\"He\\'ll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the\\noven.\" Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh\\'s forehead.\\n\"You\\'re known; you\\'ll be safe enough in the halls. We\\'ve no more time for chitchat, traitor. I hear the others coming.\"\\nTraitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar,\\nknowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.\\nHe passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them,\\nfearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore\\nHarkonnen uniform.\\nHarkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front\\nentrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to\\nilluminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees\\npoured upward through orange flames.\\n\"It\\'s the traitor,\" someone said.\\n\"The Baron will want to see you soon,\" another said.\\nI must get to the \\'thopter, Yueh thought. I must put the ducal signet where\\nPaul will find it. And fear struck him: If Idaho suspects me or grows impatient-if he doesn\\'t wait and go exactly where I told him--Jessica and Paul will not\\nbe saved from the carnage. I\\'ll be denied even the smallest relief from my act.\\nThe Harkonnen guard released his arm, said \"Wait over there out of the way.\"\\nAbruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared\\nnothing, given not the smallest pity. Idaho must not fail!\\nAnother guard bumped into him, barked: \"Stay out of the way, you!\"\\nEven when they\\'ve profited by me they despise me. Yueh thought. He\\nstraightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.\\n\"Wait for the Baron!\" a guard officer snarled.\\nYueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house,\\nturned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every\\nstep betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory\\nwhere the \\'thopter waited--the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul\\nand his mother.\\nA guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on\\nthe lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room.\\nHow confident they were!\\nYueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the \\'thopter, eased open the\\ndoor on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the\\nFremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He\\nfelt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed\\nthe ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.\\nSoftly, Yueh closed the \\'thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of\\nthe house and around toward the flaming trees.\\nNow, it is done, he thought.\\nOnce more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his\\ncloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the\\nBaron and I will know. And the Baron--he will encounter a small tooth.\\n', 21: '\\nThere is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked\\nacross the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.\\n-the Princess Irulan: \"Introduction to A Child\\'s History of Muad\\'Dib\"\\n\\n\\x0cThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he\\nwas using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of\\nArrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret\\nweapon was doing its work.\\nExplosive artillery.\\nThe guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke\\'s fighting men had retreated\\nfor a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock\\nand dust in the brief illumination--and the Duke\\'s men were being sealed off to\\ndie by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.\\nThe Baron could feel the distant chomping--a drumbeat carried to him through\\nthe ship\\'s metal: broomp . . . broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!\\nWho would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought\\nwas a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke\\'s men would run for\\nthose caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the\\nlives of our mutual force.\\nHe adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against\\nthe pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his\\njowls.\\nA pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke\\'s, he thought. He smiled more\\nbroadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by\\ndefinition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could\\nmake the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run\\nfor their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured\\nhis fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums\\nsweetly when you have enough bees working for you.\\nA door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the nigh-tblackened viewport before turning.\\nPiter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain\\nof the Baron\\'s personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door,\\nthe mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheep-like in his\\npresence.\\nThe Baron turned.\\nPiter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. \"Good news, m\\'Lord.\\nThe Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.\"\\n\"Of course they have,\" the Baron rumbled.\\nHe studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter\\'s effeminate face. And the\\neyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.\\nSoon I mast remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his\\nusefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First,\\nthough, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then--they will welcome my\\ndarling Feyd-Rautha as a savior.\\nThe Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain--Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe--a man to be trusted because the\\ncaptain\\'s vices were known.\\n\"First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?\" the Baron asked. \"I must\\ngive the traitor his reward.\"\\nPiter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.\\nA bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were\\nstiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old\\neyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a\\nmotion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron.\\n\"Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.\"\\n\"M\\'Lord Harkonnen.\"\\n\"You\\'ve given us the Duke, I hear.\"\\n\"My half of the bargain, m\\'Lord.\"\\nThe Baron looked at Piter.\\nPiter nodded.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Baron looked back at Yueh. \"The letter of the bargain, eh? And I . . .\"\\nHe spat the words out: \"What was I to do in return?\"\\n\"You remember quite well, m\\'Lord Harkonnen.\"\\nAnd Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in\\nhis mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron\\'s manner. Wanna was\\nindeed dead--gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there\\'d still be a hold on\\nthe weak doctor. The Baron\\'s manner showed there was no hold; it was ended.\\n\"Do I?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.\"\\nThe Baron nodded. \"Oh, yes. Now, I remember. So I did. That was my promise.\\nThat was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn\\'t endure seeing your\\nBene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter\\'s pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir\\nHarkonnen always keeps his promises. I told you I\\'d free her from the agony and\\npermit you to join her. So be it.\" He waved a hand at Piter.\\nPiter\\'s blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was catlike in its sudden\\nfluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh\\'s\\nback.\\nThe old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron.\\n\"So join her!\" the Baron spat.\\nYueh stood, swaying, His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice\\ncame in oddly measured cadence: \"You . . . think . . . you . . . de . . . feated\\n. . . me. You . . . think . . . I . . . did . . . not . . . know . . . what . .\\n. I . . . bought . . . for . . . my . . . Wanna.\"\\nHe toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling.\\n\"So join her,\" the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.\\nYueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to\\nPiter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy\\nlook of satisfaction in the blue eyes.\\nSo that\\'s how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. It\\'s well to\\nknow.\\n\"He did give us the Duke?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"Of a certainty, my Lord,\" Piter said.\\n\"Then get him in here!\"\\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.\\nThe Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could\\nsuspect oak in him instead of bones.\\n\"I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,\" the Baron said. \"Not even a\\ntraitor I created.\"\\nHe glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out\\nthere was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the\\nShield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron\\'s\\nmind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of\\nblack. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain\\nwhite.\\nBut there was still the feeling of doubt.\\nWhat had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he\\'d probably known what\\nwould happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he\\'d been defeated:\\n\"You think you defeated me.\"\\nWhat had he meant?\\nThe Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains,\\nthe eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped\\noff his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been\\nremoved without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke\\'s eyes held a glazed,\\ninsane look.\\n\"Wel-l-l-l,\" the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew\\nhe had spoken too loudly. This moment, long envisioned, had lost some of its\\nsavor.\\n\\n\\x0cDamn that cursed doctor through all eternity!\\n\"I believe the good Duke is drugged,\" Piter said. \"That\\'s how Yueh caught\\nhim for us.\" Piter turned to the Duke. \"Aren\\'t you drugged, my dear Duke?\"\\nThe voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his\\ncracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in\\nhis mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only\\ndim shapes through the blanket.\\n\"What of the woman and the boy, Piter?\" the Baron asked. \"Any word yet?\"\\nPiter\\'s tongue darted over his lips.\\n\"You\\'ve heard something!\" the Baron snapped. \"What?\"\\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. \"The men who were\\nsent to do the job, m\\'Lord--they\\'ve . . . ah . . . been . . . ah . . . found.\"\\n\"Well, they report everything satisfactory?\"\\n\"They\\'re dead, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Of course they are! What I want to know is--\"\\n\"They were dead when found, m\\'Lord.\"\\nThe Baron\\'s face went livid. \"And the woman and boy?\"\\n\"No sign, m\\'Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being\\ninvestigated. Perhaps it\\'s as we wished--an accident. Possibly--\"\\n\"We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing \\'thopter? Does\\nthat suggest anything to my Mentat?\"\\n\"One of the Duke\\'s men obviously escaped in it, m\\'Lord. Killed our pilot and\\nescaped.\"\\n\"Which of the Duke\\'s men?\"\\n\"It was a clean, silent killing, m\\'Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck\\none. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant.\"\\n\"Possibilities,\" the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged\\nfigure of the Duke.\\n\"The situation is in hand, m\\'Lord,\" Piter said.\\n\"No, it isn\\'t! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?\"\\n\"We\\'ve word where to find him and he\\'s been sent for, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like the way the Emperor\\'s servant is helping us,\" the Baron\\nmuttered.\\nThey were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto\\'s\\nmind. Woman and boy--no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of\\nHawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.\\n\"Where is the ducal signet ring?\" the Baron demanded. \"His finger is bare.\"\\n\"The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,\" the guard\\ncaptain said.\\n\"You killed the doctor too soon,\" the Baron said. \"That was a mistake. You\\nshould\\'ve warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our\\nenterprise.\" He scowled. \"Possibilities!\"\\nThe thought hung like a sine wave in Leto\\'s mind: Paul and Jessica have\\nescaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost\\nremember it.\\nThe tooth!\\nHe remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false\\ntooth.\\nSomeone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He\\ncould feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it.\\nNot yet!\\nThe someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told\\nhim? He couldn\\'t remember.\\n\"How long will he remain drugged like this?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"Perhaps another hour, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Perhaps,\" the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened\\nwindow. \"I am hungry.\"\\n\\n\\x0cThat\\'s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape\\ndanced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room\\nexpanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness\\nand faded.\\nTime became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. I\\nmust wait.\\nThere was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on\\nthe other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt\\nhimself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps\\nthat held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage\\nof time, but its length escaped him.\\n\"I believe he\\'s coming around. Baron.\"\\nA silky voice, that one. That was Piter.\\n\"So I see, Piter.\"\\nA rumbling basso: the Baron.\\nLeto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath him\\ntook on firmness, the bindings were sharper.\\nAnd he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man\\'s\\nhands: compulsive touchings--the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a\\nfinger tracing the fold of a jowl.\\nLeto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.\\n\"You can hear me, Duke Leto,\" the Baron said. \"I know you can hear me. We\\nwant to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on\\nher.\"\\nNo sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him.\\nIt\\'s true, then: they don\\'t have Paul and Jessica.\\n\"This is not a child\\'s game we play,\" the Baron rumbled. \"You must know\\nthat.\" He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this\\ncould not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see\\nroyalty in such straits--it set a bad precedent.\\nLeto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth\\nstood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped\\ncapsule within that tooth--the poison gas--he remembered who had put the deadly\\nweapon in his mouth.\\nYueh.\\nDrug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room\\nhung like a vapor in Leto\\'s mind. He knew it had been Yueh.\\n\"Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?\" the Baron asked.\\nLeto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone\\'s agony.\\n\"We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen, \" the Baron said. \"We\\npenetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent\\namong the Fremen to spy on them. I\\'ve lived for a time on this planet, cher\\ncousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you\\nbuy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?\"\\nLeto felt fear tighten his chest. If Yueh sent them to the desert fold . . .\\nthe search won\\'t stop until they \\'re found.\\n\"Come, come,\" the Baron said. \"We don\\'t have much time and pain is quick.\\nPlease don\\'t bring it to this, my dear Duke.\" The Baron looked up at Piter who\\nstood at Leto\\'s shoulder. \"Piter doesn\\'t have all his tools here, but I\\'m sure\\nhe could improvise.\"\\n\"Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.\"\\nThat silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.\\n\"You had an emergency plan,\" the Baron said. \"Where have your woman and the\\nboy been sent?\" He looked at Leto\\'s hand. \"Your ring is missing. Does the boy\\nhave it?\"\\nThe Baron looked up, stared into Leto\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\\x0c\"You don\\'t answer,\" he said. \"Will you force me to do a thing I do not want\\nto do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. I agree they\\'re sometimes the\\nbest, but it\\'s not good that you should be subjected to such things.\"\\n\"Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids,\" Piter said. \"Perhaps\\non other portions of the body. It\\'s especially effective when the subject\\ndoesn\\'t know where the tallow will fall next. It\\'s a good method and there\\'s a\\nsort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?\"\\n\"Exquisite,\" the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.\\nThose touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on\\nbaby-fat hands--their compulsive wandering.\\nThe sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke\\'s\\nnerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?\\n\"Believe me, cher cousin,\" the Baron said. \"I do not want it to come to\\nthis.\"\\n\"You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,\" Piter\\nsaid. \"There\\'s an artistry in this, you know.\"\\n\"You\\'re a superb artist,\" the Baron growled. \"Now, have the decency to be\\nsilent.\"\\nLeto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a\\npicture of the Baron: \" \\'And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast\\nrise up out of the sea . . . and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.\\' \"\\n\"We waste time, Baron,\" Piter said.\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\nThe Baron nodded. \"You know, my dear Leto, you\\'ll tell us in the end where\\nthey are. There\\'s a level of pain that\\'ll buy you.\"\\nHe\\'s most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth . . . and\\nthe fact that I truly don\\'t know where they are.\\nThe Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth,\\nchewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.\\n\"Observe this prize person who denies he\\'s for hire,\" the Baron said.\\n\"Observe him, Piter.\"\\nAnd the Baron thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot\\nbe bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in\\ndribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he\\'d\\nrattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?\\nThe frog sounds in the background stopped.\\nThe Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across\\nthe room, shake his head. The captive hadn\\'t produced the needed information.\\nAnother failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft\\nfool who didn\\'t realize how much hell there was so near him--only a nerve\\'s\\nthickness away.\\nThis thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal\\nperson subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising endless\\nsupple scissor dissections--cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell\\nbeneath.\\nRabbits, all of them!\\nAnd how they cowered when they saw the carnivore!\\nLeto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end\\nit all quickly. Still--it had been good, much of this life. He found himself\\nremembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell-blue sky of Caladan, and\\nPaul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on\\nArrakis--colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.\\n\"Too bad,\" the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood\\nup lightly in his suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke.\\nHe saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a\\nmuscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.\\nHow he fears me! the Baron thought.\\n\\n\\x0cShocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the\\ncapsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he\\ncould taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in\\na tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear--the silky-voiced one:\\nPiter.\\nIt got him, too!\\n\"Piter! What\\'s wrong?\"\\nThe rumbling voice was far away.\\nLeto sensed memories rolling in his mind--the old toothless mutterings of\\nhags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes--blue within\\nblue, the eyes--all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.\\nThere was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a\\nbroken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the\\nstart of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery--so distant--a\\nroaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything.\\nEverything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every . . . silence.\\nOne thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black:\\nThe day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him\\nwith a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.\\nSilence.\\nThe Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole\\nbehind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took\\nin guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever it\\nwas in there, did it get me, too?\\nSounds returned to him . . . and reason. He heard someone shouting orders-gas masks . . . keep a door closed . . . get blowers going.\\nThe others fell quickly, he thought. I\\'m still standing. I\\'m still\\nbreathing. Merciless hell! That was close!\\nHe could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still\\nenough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been\\npushing himself away from the table . . . that and Piter\\'s shocked gasp which\\nhad brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.\\nChance and the warning in a dying man\\'s gasp--these had saved him.\\nThe Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And\\nthat stupid guard captain! He\\'d said he scoped everyone before bringing them\\ninto the Baron\\'s presence! How had it been possible for the Duke . . . ? No\\nwarning. Not even from the poison snooper over the table--until it was too late.\\nHow?\\nWell, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard\\ncaptain will begin by finding answers to these questions.\\nHe grew aware of more activity down the hall--around the corner at the other\\ndoor to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door,\\nstudied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for\\nthe Baron\\'s reaction.\\nWould the Baron be angry?\\nAnd the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from\\nthat terrible room.\\nSome of the guards had weapons leveled at the door. Some were directing\\ntheir ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises\\naround the corner to their right.\\nA man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps at\\nhis neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this\\ncorridor. He was yellow-haired, flat of face with green eyes. Crisp lines\\nradiated from his thick-lipped mouth. He looked like some water creature\\nmisplaced among those who walked the land.\\nThe Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud. Iakin\\nNefud. Guard corporal. Nefud was addicted to semuta, the drug-music combination\\n\\n\\x0cthat played itself in the deepest consciousness. A useful item of information,\\nthat.\\nThe man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted. \"Corridor\\'s clear, m\\'Lord. I\\nwas outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas. Ventilators in your\\nroom were pulling air in from these corridors.\" He glanced up at the snooper\\nover the Baron\\'s head. \"None of the stuff escaped. We have the room cleaned out\\nnow. What are your orders?\"\\nThe Baron recognized the man\\'s voice--the one who\\'d been shouting orders.\\nEfficient, this corporal, he thought.\\n\"They\\'re all dead in there?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\nWell, we must adjust, the Baron thought.\\n\"First,\" he said, \"let me congratulate you, Nefud. You\\'re the new captain of\\nmy guard. And I hope you\\'ll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate\\nof your predecessor.\"\\nThe Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman. Nefud\\nknew he\\'d never again be without his semuta.\\nNefud nodded. \"My Lord knows I\\'ll devote myself entirely to his safety.\"\\n\"Yes. Well, to business. I suspect the Duke had something in his mouth. You\\nwill find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped him put it\\nthere. You\\'ll take every precaution--\"\\nHe broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the\\ncorridor behind him--guards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the\\nfrigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the\\nlift.\\nThe Baron couldn\\'t place the colonel bashar\\'s face: thin with mouth like a\\nslash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes.\\n\"Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion-eaters!\" the man roared, and he\\ndashed the guards aside.\\nAh-h-h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thought.\\nThe colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to slits\\nof apprehension. The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease. They all seemed\\nto look like relatives of the Duke . . . the late Duke. And their manners with\\nthe Baron!\\nThe colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron, hands\\non hips. The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.\\nThe Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukar\\'s\\nmanner, and his unease grew. There was only the one legion of them locally--ten\\nbrigades--reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but the Baron did not fool himself.\\nThat one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and\\novercoming them.\\n\"Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron,\" the\\nSardaukar growled. \"My men brought you the Atreides Duke before I could discuss\\nhis fate with you. We will discuss it now.\"\\nI must not lose face before my men, the Baron thought.\\n\"So?\" It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.\\n\"My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly\\nwithout agony,\" the colonel bashar said.\\n\"Such were the Imperial orders to me,\" the Baron lied. \"Did you think I\\'d\\ndisobey?\"\\n\"I\\'m to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes,\" the Sardaukar\\nsaid.\\n\"The Duke\\'s already dead,\" the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss\\nthe fellow.\\nThe colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron. Not by flicker of eye\\nor muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed. \"How?\" he growled.\\nReally! the Baron thought. This is too much.\\n\\n\\x0c\"By his own hand, if you must know,\" the Baron said. \"He took poison.\"\\n\"I will see the body now,\" the colonel Bashar said.\\nThe Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his\\nthoughts raced. Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a\\nthing\\'s been changed!\\n\"Now,\" the Sardaukar growled. \"I\\'ll see it with my own eyes.\"\\nThere was no preventing it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see all.\\nHe\\'d know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men . . . that the Baron most likely had\\nescaped by a narrow margin. There was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the\\ntable, and the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him.\\nNo preventing it at all.\\n\"I\\'ll not be put off,\" the colonel bashar snarled.\\n\"You\\'re not being put off,\" the Baron said, and he stared into the\\nSardaukar\\'s obsidian eyes. \"I hide nothing from my Emperor.\" He nodded to Nefud.\\n\"The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in by the door where\\nyou stood, Nefud.\"\\n\"This way, sir,\" Nefud said.\\nSlowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way\\nthrough the guardsmen.\\nInsufferable, the Baron thought. Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped\\nup. He\\'ll recognize it as a sign of weakness.\\nAnd it was agonizing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were\\nalike in their disdain for weakness. The Baron chewed at his lower lip,\\nconsoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the Atreides\\nraid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Harkonnen spice stores there.\\nDamn that slippery Duke!\\nThe Baron watched the retreating backs--the arrogant Sardaukar and the\\nstocky, efficient Nefud.\\nWe must adjust, the Baron thought. I\\'ll have to put Rabban over this\\ndamnable planet once more. Without restraint. I must spend my own Harkonnen\\nblood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for accepting Feyd-Rautha. Damn\\nthat Piter! He would get himself killed before I was through with him.\\nThe Baron sighed.\\nAnd I must send at once to Tleielax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly have\\nthe new one ready for me by now.\\nOne of the guardsmen beside him coughed.\\nThe Baron turned toward the man. \"I am hungry.\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"And I wish to be diverted while you\\'re clearing out that room and studying\\nits secrets for me,\" the Baron rumbled.\\nThe guardsman lowered his eyes. \"What diversion does m\\'Lord wish?\"\\n\"I\\'ll be in my sleeping chambers,\" the Baron said. \"Bring me that young\\nfellow we bought on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don\\'t\\nfeel like wrestling.\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\nThe Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor-buoyed pace\\ntoward his chambers. Yes, he thought. The one with the lovely eyes, the one who\\nlooks so much like the young Paul Atreides.\\n', 22: '\\nO Seas of Caladan,\\nO people of Duke Leto-Citadel of Leto fallen,\\nFallen forever . . .\\n-from \"Songs of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\n\\x0cPaul felt that all his past, every experience before this night, had become\\nsand curling in an hourglass. He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a\\nsmall fabric and plastic hutment--a stilltent--that had come, like the Fremen\\nclothing they now wore, from the pack left in the \\'thopter.\\nThere was no doubt in Paul\\'s mind who had put the Fremkit there, who had\\ndirected the course of the \\'thopter carrying them captive.\\nYueh.\\nThe traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of Duncan Idaho.\\nPaul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed\\nrocks that ringed this place where Idaho had hidden them.\\nHiding like a child when I\\'m now the Duke, Paul thought. He felt the thought\\ngall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did.\\nSomething had happened to his awareness this night--he saw with sharpened\\nclarity every circumstance and occurrence around him. He felt unable to stop the\\ninflow of data or the cold precision with which each new item was added to his\\nknowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness. It was Mentat power\\nand more.\\nPaul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange \\'thopter\\ndived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert\\nwith wind screaming through its wings. The thing in Paul\\'s mind had happened\\nthen. The \\'thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running\\nfigures--his mother and himself. Paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur\\nfrom abrasion of \\'thopter skids against sand had drifted across them.\\nHis mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of\\nHarkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the\\n\\'thopter\\'s open door shouting: \"Hurry! There\\'s wormsign south of you!\"\\nBut Paul had known as he turned who piloted the \\'thopter. An accumulation of\\nminutiae in the way it was flown, the dash of the landing--clues so small even\\nhis mother hadn\\'t detected them--had told Paul precisely who sat at those\\ncontrols.\\nAcross the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: \"There can be only\\none explanation. The Harkonnens held Yueh\\'s wife. He hated the Harkonnens! I\\ncannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the\\ncarnage?\"\\nShe is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a\\nshock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that\\nhad accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.\\n\"Do not try to forgive me,\" Yueh had written. \"I do not want your\\nforgiveness. I already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without\\nmalice or hope of another\\'s understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my\\nultimate test. I give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that I write truly.\\nBy the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead. Take consolation from my\\nassurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with\\nhim.\"\\nIt had not been addressed or signed, but there \\'d been no mistaking the\\nfamiliar scrawl--Yueh\\'s.\\nRemembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment--a\\nthing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mentat alertness.\\nHe had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words, but had felt\\nthem as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.\\nI loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. I should mourn\\nhim. I should feel something.\\nBut he felt nothing except: Here\\'s an important fact.\\nIt was one with all the other facts.\\nAll the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating,\\ncomputing.\\n\\n\\x0cHalleck\\'s words came back to Paul: \"Mood\\'s a thing for cattle or for making\\nlove. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood. \"\\nPerhaps that\\'s it, Paul thought. I\\'ll mourn my father later . . . when\\nthere\\'s time.\\nBut he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that his\\nnew awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing. The sense of terrible\\npurpose he\\'d first experienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius\\nHelen Mohiam pervaded him. His right hand--the hand of remembered pain--tingled\\nand throbbed.\\nIs this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.\\n\"For a while, I thought Hawat had failed us again, \"Jessica said. \"I thought\\nperhaps Yueh wasn\\'t a Suk doctor.\"\\n\"He was everything we thought him . . . and more,\" Paul said. And he\\nthought: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, \"If Idaho doesn\\'t get\\nthrough to Kynes, we\\'ll be--\"\\n\"He\\'s not our only hope,\" she said.\\n\"Such was not my suggestion,\" he said.\\nShe heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across\\nthe grey darkness of the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette against moon-frosted rocks seen through the tent\\'s transparent end.\\n\"Others among your father\\'s men will have escaped,\" she said. \"We must\\nregather them, find--\"\\n\"We will depend upon ourselves,\" he said. \"Our immediate concern is our\\nfamily atomics. We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them out.\"\\n\"Not likely they\\'ll be found,\" she said, \"the way they were hidden.\"\\n\"It must not be left to chance.\"\\nAnd she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet\\nand its spice--that\\'s what he has in mind. But all he can hope for then is\\nescape into renegade anonymity.\\nHis mother\\'s words had provoked another train of thought in Paul--a duke\\'s\\nconcern for all the people they\\'d lost this night. People are the true strength\\nof a Great House, Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat\\'s words: \"Parting with\\npeople is a sadness; a place is only a place.\"\\n\"They\\'re using Sardaukar,\" Jessica said. \"We must wait until the Sardaukar\\nhave been withdrawn.\"\\n\"They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar,\" Paul said.\\n\"They intend that there be no Atreides survivors--total extermination. Do not\\ncount on any of our people escaping.\"\\n\"They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperor\\'s part in\\nthis.\"\\n\"Can\\'t they?\"\\n\"Some of our people are bound to escape.\"\\n\"Are they?\"\\nJessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son\\'s voice,\\nhearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his mind had leaped\\nahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did. She had helped\\ntrain the intelligence which did this, but now she found herself fearful of it.\\nHer thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears\\nburned her eyes.\\nThis is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought. \"A time of love and a time\\nof grief.\" She rested her hand on her abdomen, awareness focused on the embryo\\nthere. I have the Atreides daughter I was ordered to produce, but the Reverend\\nMother was wrong: a daughter wouldn\\'t have saved my Leto. This child is only\\nlife reaching for the future in the midst of death. I conceived out of instinct\\nand not out of obedience.\\n\"Try the communinet receiver again,\" Paul said.\\nThe mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch.\\nA green light glowed on the instrument\\'s face. Tinny screeching came from its\\nspeaker. She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands. A voice speaking\\nAtreides battle language came into the tent.\\n\" . . . back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no survivors in Carthag\\nand the Guild Bank has been sacked.\"\\nCarthag! Jessica thought. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.\\n\"They\\'re Sardaukar,\" the voice said. \"Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides\\nuniforms. They\\'re . . . \"\\nA roaring filled the speaker, then silence.\\n\"Try the other bands,\" Paul said.\\n\"Do you realize what that means?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"I expected it. They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their\\nbank. With the Guild against us, we\\'re trapped on Arrakis. Try the other bands.\"\\nShe weighed his words: I expected it. What had happened to him? Slowly,\\nJessica returned to the instrument. As she moved the bandslide, they caught\\nglimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in Atreides battle language:\\n\" . . . fallback . . . \" \" . . . try to regroup at . . . \" \" . . . trapped in a\\ncave at . . . .\"\\nAnd there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen\\ngibberish that poured from the other bands. Sharp commands, battle reports.\\nThere wasn\\'t enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but\\nthe tone was obvious.\\nHarkonnen victory.\\nPaul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle\\nthere. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent\\nat the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His left hand felt the\\nsphincter-seal of the tent\\'s entrance. \"It\\'ll be dawn soon,\" he said. \"We can\\nwait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night. In the desert,\\nyou must travel by night and rest in shade through the day.\"\\nRemembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica\\'s mind: Without a stillsuit,\\na man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to\\nmaintain body weight. She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her\\nbody, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.\\n\"If we leave here, Idaho can\\'t find us,\" she said.\\n\"There are ways to make any man talk,\" he said. \"If Idaho hasn\\'t returned by\\ndawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured. How long do you\\nthink he could hold out?\"\\nThe question required no answer, and she sat in silence.\\nPaul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab\\nand magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages:\\n\"literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit\\nrepkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt-plugs, paracompass, maker hooks,\\nthumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar . . . \"\\nSo many things for survival on the desert.\\nPresently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor.\\n\"Where can we possibly go?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"My father spoke of desert power,\" Paul said. \"The Harkonnens cannot rule\\nthis planet without it. They\\'ve never ruled this planet, nor shall they. Not\\neven with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar.\"\\n\"Paul, you can\\'t think that--\"\\n\"We\\'ve all the evidence in our hands,\" he said. \"Right here in this tent-the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild\\nwants a prohibitive price for weather satellites. We know that--\"\\n\"What\\'ve weather satellites to do with it?\" she asked. \"They couldn\\'t\\npossibly . . . \" She broke off.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing\\non minutiae. \"You see it now,\" he said. \"Satellites watch the terrain below.\\nThere are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection.\"\\n\"You\\'re suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?\"\\nShe was so slow.\\n\"No!\" he said. \"The Fremen! They\\'re paying the Guild for privacy, paying in\\na coin that\\'s freely available to anyone with desert power--spice. This is more\\nthan a second-approximation answer; it\\'s the straight-line computation. Depend\\non it.\"\\n\"Paul.\" Jessica said, \"you\\'re not a Mentat yet; you can\\'t know for sure how-\"\\n\"I\\'ll never be a Mentat,\" he said. \"I\\'m something else . . . a freak.\"\\n\"Paul! How can you say such--\"\\n\"Leave me alone!\"\\nHe turned away from her, looking out into the night. Why can\\'t I mourn? he\\nwondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it\\nwould be denied him forever.\\nJessica had never heard such distress in her son\\'s voice. She wanted to\\nreach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him--but she sensed there was\\nnothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.\\nThe glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught\\nher eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: \"Manual of \\'The\\nFriendly Desert,\\' the place full of life. Here are the ayat and burhan of Life.\\nBelieve, and al-Lat shall never burn you.\"\\nIt reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the\\nGreat Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?\\nPaul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: \"Think of all\\nthese special-application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled sophistication.\\nAdmit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected.\"\\nHesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to\\nthe book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: \"Muad\\'Dib:\\nThe Mouse,\" and noted that the tail pointed north.\\nPaul stared into the tent\\'s darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his\\nmother revealed by the manual\\'s glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my\\nfather\\'s wish, he thought. I must give her his message now while she has time\\nfor grief. Grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself shocked by\\nprecise logic.\\n\"Mother,\" he said.\\n\"Yes?\"\\nShe heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the\\nsound. Never had she heard such harsh control.\\n\"My father is dead,\" he said.\\nShe searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact--the\\nBene Gesserit way of assessing data--and it came to her: the sensation of\\nterrifying loss.\\nJessica nodded, unable to speak.\\n\"My father charged me once,\" Paul said, \"to give you a message if anything\\nhappened to him. He feared you might believe he distrusted you.\"\\nThat useless suspicion, she thought.\\n\"He wanted you to know he never suspected you,\" Paul said, and explained the\\ndeception, adding: \"He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely,\\nalways loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted\\nhimself and he had but one regret--that he never made you his Duchess.\"\\nShe brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste\\nof the body\\'s water! But she knew this thought for what it was--the attempt to\\nretreat from grief into anger. Leto, my Leto, she thought. What terrible things\\n\\n\\x0cwe do to those we love! With a violent motion, she extinguished the little\\nmanual\\'s glowtab.\\nSobs shook her.\\nPaul heard his mother\\'s grief and felt the emptiness within himself. I have\\nno grief, he thought. Why? Why? He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible\\nflaw.\\n\"A time to get and time to lose,\" Jessica thought, quoting to herself from\\nthe O.C. Bible. \"A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and a\\ntime to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. \"\\nPaul\\'s mind had gone on in its chilling precision. He saw the avenues ahead\\nof them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he\\nfocused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable\\nfutures, but with something more, an edge of mystery--as though his mind dipped\\ninto some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.\\nAbruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Paul\\'s mind climbed\\nanother notch in awareness. He felt himself clinging to this new level,\\nclutching at a precarious hold and peering about. It was as though he existed\\nwithin a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions . . . yet this only\\napproximated the sensation.\\nHe remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he\\nsensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and\\nimpermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.\\nHe saw people.\\nHe felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.\\nHe knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data\\nof innumerable unexplored crannies. There was time to probe and test and taste,\\nbut no time to shape.\\nThe thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the\\nmost remote future--from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his\\nown death in countless ways. He saw new planets, new cultures.\\nPeople.\\nPeople.\\nHe saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued\\nthem.\\nEven the Guildsmen.\\nAnd he thought: The Guild--there\\' d be a way for us, my strangeness accepted\\nas a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the now-necessary spice.\\nBut the idea of living out his life in the mind-groping-ahead-through-possible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him. It was a way,\\nthough. And in meeting the possible future that contained Guildsmen he\\nrecognized his own strangeness.\\nI have another kind of sight. I see another kind of terrain: the available\\npaths.\\nThe awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm--so many places on that\\nother kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.\\nAs swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he\\nrealized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.\\nYet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a\\nterrifying way. He stared around him.\\nNight still covered the stilltent within its rock-enclosed hideaway. His\\nmother\\'s grief could still be heard.\\nHis own lack of grief could still be felt . . . that hollow place somewhere\\nseparated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace--dealing with data,\\nevaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.\\nAnd now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had\\nencompassed. But this made the empty place within him no easier to bear. He felt\\n\\n\\x0cthat something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had\\nbeen set to ticking within him. It went on about its business no matter what he\\nwanted. It recorded minuscule shadings of difference around him--a slight change\\nin moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across\\ntheir stilltent roof, the solemn approach of dawn in the star-lighted patch of\\nsky he could see out the tent\\'s transparent end.\\nThe emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in\\nmotion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the start of\\nit--the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of\\nsophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible at a critical moment\\n. . . and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he could look ahead--the most\\nterrifying direction--to see where it all pointed.\\nI\\'m a monster! he thought. A freak!\\n\"No,\" he said. Then: \"No. No! NO!\"\\nHe found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists. (The implacable\\npart of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into\\ncomputation.)\\n\"Paul!\"\\nHis mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering\\nat him. \"Paul, what\\'s wrong?\"\\n\"You!\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m here, Paul,\" she said. \"It\\'s all right.\"\\n\"What have you done to me?\" he demanded.\\nIn a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said:\\n\"I gave birth to you.\"\\nIt was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely\\ncorrect answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim\\noutline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in\\nthe new way by his onflowing mind, the clues added to other data, and a final summation answer put forward.)\\n\"Let go of me,\" he said.\\nShe heard the iron in his voice, obeyed. \"Do you want to tell me what\\'s\\nwrong, Paul?\"\\n\"Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?\" he asked.\\nThere\\'s no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: \"I hoped\\nthe thing any parent hopes--that you\\'d be . . . superior, different.\"\\n\"Different?\"\\nShe heard the bitterness in his tone, said: \"Paul, I--\"\\n\"You didn\\'t want a son!\" he said. \"You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You wanted\\na male Bene Gesserit!\"\\nShe recoiled from his bitterness. \"But Paul . . .\"\\n\"Did you ever consult my father in this?\"\\nShe spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: \"Whatever you are, Paul,\\nthe heredity is as much your father as me.\"\\n\"But not the training,\" he said. \"Not the things that . . . awakened . . .\\nthe sleeper.\"\\n\"Sleeper?\"\\n\"It\\'s here.\" He put a hand to his head and then to his breast. \"In me. It\\ngoes on and on and on and on and--\"\\n\"Paul!\"\\nShe had heard the hysteria edging his voice.\\n\"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my\\ndreams: You listen in her place now. I\\'ve just had a waking dream. Do you know\\nwhy?\"\\n\"You must calm yourself,\" she said. \"If there\\'s--\"\\n\"The spice,\" he said, \"It\\'s in everything here--the air, the soil, the food.\\nThe geriatric spice. It\\'s like the Truthsayer drug. It\\'s a poison!\"\\n\\n\\x0cShe stiffened.\\nHis voice lowered and he repeated: \"A poison--so subtle, so insidious . . .\\nso irreversible. It won\\'t even kill you unless you stop taking it. We can\\'t\\nleave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us.\"\\nThe terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.\\n\"You and the spice,\" Paul said. \"The spice changes anyone who gets this much\\nof it, but thanks to you, I could bring the change to consciousness. I don\\'t get\\nto leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out. I can\\nsee it.\"\\n\"Paul, you--\"\\n\"I see it!\" he repeated.\\nShe heard madness in his voice, didn\\'t know what to do.\\nBut he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: \"We\\'re\\ntrapped here.\"\\nWe\\'re trapped here, she agreed.\\nAnd she accepted the truth of his words. No pressure of the Bene Gesserit,\\nno trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the spice\\nwas addictive. Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.\\nSo here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell-planet. The place\\nis prepared for us, if we can evade the Harkonnens. And there\\'s no doubt of my\\ncourse: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit\\nPlan.\\n\"I must tell you about my waking dream,\" Paul said. (Now there was fury in\\nhis voice.) \"To be sure you accept what I say, I\\'ll tell you first I know you\\'ll\\nbear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis.\"\\nJessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against the\\ncurving fabric wall to still a pang of fear. She knew her pregnancy could not\\nshow yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first\\nfaint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.\\n\"Only to serve,\" Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto. \"We\\nexist only to serve.\"\\n\"We\\'ll find a home among the Fremen,\" Paul said, \"where your Missionaria\\nProtectiva has bought us a bolt hole.\"\\nThey\\'ve prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself. But how\\ncan he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult\\nto subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.\\nHe studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with\\nhis new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light. A beginning of\\ncompassion for her crept over him.\\n\"The things that can happen here, I cannot begin to tell you,\" he said. \"I\\ncannot even begin to tell myself, although I\\'ve seen them. This sense of the\\nfuture--I seem to have no control over it. The thing just happens. The immediate\\nfuture--say, a year--I can see some of that . . . a road as broad as our Central\\nAvenue on Caladan. Some places I don\\'t see . . . shadowed places . . . as though\\nit went behind a hill\" (and again he thought of the surface of a blowing\\nkerchief) \" . . . and there are branchings . . . \"\\nHe fell silent as memory of that seeing filled him. No prescient dream, no\\nexperience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the\\nveils had been ripped away to reveal naked time.\\nRecalling the experience, he recognized his own terrible purpose--the\\npressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble . . . time\\nretreating before it . . .\\nJessica found the tent\\'s glowtab control, activated it.\\nDim green light drove back the shadows, easing her fear. She looked at\\nPaul\\'s face, his eyes--the inward stare. And she knew where she had seen such a\\nlook before: pictured in records of disasters--on the faces of children who\\n\\n\\x0cexperienced starvation or terrible injury. The eyes were like pits, mouth a\\nstraight line, cheeks indrawn.\\nIt\\'s the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the\\nknowledge of his own mortality.\\nHe was, indeed, no longer a child.\\nThe underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing\\nall else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them.\\n\"There\\'s a way to evade the Harkonnens,\" she said.\\n\"The Harkonnens!\" he sneered. \"Put those twisted humans out of your mind.\"\\nHe stared at his mother, studying the lines of her face in the light of the\\nglowtab. The lines betrayed her.\\nShe said: \"You shouldn\\'t refer to people as humans without--\"\\n\"Don\\'t be so sure you know where to draw the line,\" he said. \"We carry our\\npast with us. And, mother mine, there\\'s a thing you don\\'t know and should--we\\nare Harkonnens.\"\\nHer mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut\\noff all sensation. But Paul\\'s voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging\\nher with it.\\n\"When next you find a mirror, study your face--study mine now. The traces\\nare there if you don\\'t blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones.\\nAnd if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I\\'ve walked the\\nfuture, I\\'ve looked at a record, I\\'ve seen a place, I have all the data. We\\'re\\nHarkonnens.\"\\n\"A . . . renegade branch of the family,\" she said. \"That\\'s it, isn\\'t it?\\nSome Harkonnen cousin who--\"\\n\"You\\'re the Baron\\'s own daughter,\" he said, and watched the way she pressed\\nher hands to her mouth. \"The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once\\npermitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene\\nGesserit, by one of you.\"\\nThe way he said \\'you\\' struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working\\nand she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past\\nreached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted--it wasn\\'t to\\nend the old Atreides-Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their\\nlines. What? She groped for an answer.\\nAs though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: \"They thought they were\\nreaching for me. But I\\'m not what they expected, and I\\'ve arrived before my\\ntime. And they don\\'t know it.\"\\nJessica pressed her hands to her mouth.\\nGreat Mother! He\\'s the Kwisatz Haderach!\\nShe felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with\\neyes from which little could be hidden. And that, she knew, was the basis of her\\nfear.\\n\"You\\'re thinking I\\'m the Kwisatz Haderach,\" he said. \"Put that out of your\\nmind. I\\'m something unexpected.\"\\nI must get word out to one of the schools, she thought. The mating index may\\nshow what has happened.\\n\"They won\\'t learn about me until it\\'s too late,\" he said.\\nShe sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: \"We\\'ll find a place\\namong the Fremen?\"\\n\"The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity,\"\\nhe said. \"They say: \\'Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.\\' \"\\nAnd he thought: Yes, mother mine--among the Fremen. You\\'ll acquire the blue\\neyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit\\n. . . and you\\'ll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife.\\n\"If you\\'re not the Kwisatz Haderach,\" Jessica said, \"what--\"\\n\"You couldn\\'t possibly know,\" he said. \"You won\\'t believe it until you see\\nit.\"\\n\\n\\x0cAnd he thought: I\\'m a seed.\\nHe suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and\\nwith this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the\\nempty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.\\nHe had seen two main branchings along the way ahead--in one he confronted an\\nevil old Baron and said: \"Hello, Grandfather.\" The thought of that path and what\\nlay along it sickened him.\\nThe other path held long patches of grey obscurity except for peaks of\\nviolence. He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the\\nuniverse with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic\\nlegions drunk on spice liquor. Gurney Halleck and a few others of his father\\'s\\nmen--a pitiful few--were among them, all marked by the hawk symbol from the\\nshrine of his father\\'s skull.\\n\"I can\\'t go that way,\" he muttered. \"That\\'s what the old witches of your\\nschools really want.\"\\n\"I don\\'t understand you, Paul,\" his mother said.\\nHe remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race\\nconsciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose. He found that he no\\nlonger could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They\\nwere all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance,\\nto cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes.\\nAnd the race knew only one sure way for this--the ancient way, the tried and\\ncertain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.\\nSurely, I cannot choose that way, he thought.\\nBut he saw again in his mind\\'s eye the shrine of his father\\'s skull and the\\nviolence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.\\nJessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence. \"Then . . . the Fremen\\nwill give us sanctuary?\"\\nHe looked up, staring across the green-lighted tent at the inbred, patrician\\nlines of her face. \"Yes,\" he said. \"That\\'s one of the ways.\" He nodded. \"Yes.\\nThey\\'ll call me . . . Muad\\'Dib, \\'The One Who Points the Way.\\' Yes . . . that\\'s\\nwhat they\\'ll call me.\"\\nAnd he closed his eyes, thinking: Now, my father, I can mourn you. And he\\nfelt the tears coursing down his cheeks.\\n', 23: \"\\nBook Two\\nMUAD'DIB\\n\", 24: '\\nWhen my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto\\'s death and the manner\\nof it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother\\nand the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed\\nthe Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting\\neven me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to\\ncomfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation\\nto which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and\\nasked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this\\npassion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all\\nroyalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my\\nfather, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad\\'Dib\\'s shared common\\nancestry.\\n-\"In My Father\\'s House,\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen,\" Paul whispered.\\n\\n\\x0cHe had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and\\ndarkened stilltent. As he spoke, he heard the vague stirrings of his mother\\nwhere she slept against the tent\\'s opposite wall.\\nPaul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor, studying the dials\\nilluminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes.\\n\"It should be night soon,\" his mother said. \"Why don\\'t you lift the tent\\nshades?\"\\nPaul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time, that\\nshe had lain silent in the darkness until certain he was awake.\\n\"Lifting the shades wouldn\\'t help,\" he said. \"There\\'s been a storm. The\\ntent\\'s covered by sand. I\\'ll dig us out soon.\"\\n\"No sign of Duncan yet?\"\\n\"None.\"\\nPaul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb, and a sudden rage\\nagainst the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set\\nhim trembling.\\n\"I heard the storm begin,\" Jessica said.\\nThe undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm. His\\nmind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of\\ntheir stilltent--cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and\\ntails furrowing the sky. He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape\\nunder the blast, becoming a low, Cheddar-colored wedge. Sand funneled into their\\nbasin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the\\ntent was covered.\\nTent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then--silence\\nbroken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from\\nthe surface.\\n\"Try the receiver again,\" Jessica said.\\n\"No use,\" he said.\\nHe found his stillsuit\\'s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm\\nswallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen\\nexistence--living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was\\nflat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.\\nJessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit\\nclinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept it would\\nrequire awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must\\nguard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent\\'s\\ncatchpockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.\\nSo much easier to drift back down into sleep.\\nBut there had been a dream in this day\\'s sleep, and she shivered at memory\\nof it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been\\nwritten: Duke Leto Atreides. The name had blurred with the sand and she had\\nmoved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.\\nThe sand would not stop.\\nHer dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing--part\\nof her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little\\nmore than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.\\nMy unknown mother, Jessica thought. The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave\\nme to the Sisters because that\\'s what she was commanded to do. Was she glad to\\nrid herself of a Harkonnen child?\\n\"The place to hit them is in the spice,\" Paul said.\\nHow can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself.\\n\"An entire planet full of spice,\" she said. \"How can you hit them there?\"\\nShe heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the\\ntent floor.\\n\"It was sea power and air power on Caladan,\" he said. \"Here, it\\'s desert\\npower. The Fremen are the key.\"\\n\\n\\x0cHis voice came from the vicinity of the tent\\'s sphincter. Her Bene Gesserit\\ntraining sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.\\nAll his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thought. Now, he\\nfinds he is Harkonnen . . . because of me. How little he knows me! I was my\\nDuke\\'s only woman. I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene\\nGesserit orders.\\nThe tent\\'s glowtab came alight under Paul\\'s hand, filled the domed area with\\ngreen radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for\\nthe open desert--forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted.\\nOnly his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward\\nher and away.\\n\"Secure yourself for the open,\" he said, and his voice was blurred behind\\nthe filter.\\nJessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she\\nwatched Paul break the tent seal.\\nSand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran\\ninto the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A\\nhole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and\\nher ears followed his progress to the surface.\\nWhat will we find out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the\\nSardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don\\'t\\nknow?\\nShe thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the\\npack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious\\ndangers.\\nShe felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they\\nwere exposed above the filter.\\n\"Pass up the pack.\" It was Paul\\'s voice, low and guarded.\\nShe moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack\\nacross the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.\\n\"Here,\" he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.\\nNow she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of\\nweapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The\\nmeteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave\\nslats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.\\n\"Hurry up,\" Paul said. \"I want to collapse the tent.\"\\nA shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. How much sand will\\nthe hand hold? She asked herself.\\n\"Shall I help you?\" Paul asked.\\n\"No.\"\\nShe swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed\\nsand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took her arm. She stood beside him\\non a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their\\nbasin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther\\ndarkness with her trained senses.\\nNoise of small animals.\\nBirds.\\nA fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.\\nPaul collapsing their tent, recovering it up the hole.\\nStarlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with\\nmenace. She looked at patches of blackness.\\nBlack is a blind remembering, she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for\\nthe cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most\\nprimitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.\\nPresently, Paul stood beside her, said: \"Duncan told me that if he was\\ncaptured, he could hold out . . . this long. We must leave here now.\" He\\n\\n\\x0cshouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge\\nthat looked down on open desert.\\nJessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son\\'s orbit.\\nFor now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This\\nworld has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrow\\'s life. I live now\\nfor my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.\\nShe felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Paul\\'s side.\\nHe looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.\\nThe faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined\\nby stars. The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of\\nboomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi-shaped upthrusting at the stern.\\nAn orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple\\ncut downward toward the glare.\\nAnother line of purple!\\nAnd another upthrusting orange glare!\\nIt was like an ancient naval battle, remembered shellfire, and the sight\\nheld them staring.\\n\"Pillars of fire,\" Paul whispered.\\nA ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock. Lines of purple laced the\\nsky.\\n\"Jetflares and lasguns,\" Jessica said.\\nThe dust-reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their\\nleft and they saw a storm trail there--a ribbon of movement over the desert.\\n\"It must be Harkonnen \\'thopters hunting us,\" Paul said. \"The way they\\'re\\ncutting up the desert . . . it\\'s as though they were making certain they stamped\\nout whatever\\'s there . . . the way you\\'d stamp out a nest of insects.\"\\n\"Or a nest of Atreides,\" Jessica said.\\n\"We must seek cover,\" Paul said. \"We\\'ll head south and keep to the rocks. If\\nthey caught us in the open . . .\" He turned, adjusting the pack to his\\nshoulders. \"They\\'re killing anything that moves.\"\\nHe took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, heard the low hiss of\\ngliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.\\n', 25: '\\nMy father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis\\nfor all morality. \"Something cannot emerge from nothing,\" he said. This is\\nprofound thinking if you understand how unstable \"the truth\" can be.\\n-from \"Conversations with Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"I\\'ve always prided myself on seeing things the way they truly are,\" Thufir\\nHawat said. \"That\\'s the curse of being a Mentat. You can\\'t stop analyzing your\\ndata.\"\\nThe leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke.\\nHis sapho-stained lips were drawn into a straight line with radial creases\\nspreading upward.\\nA robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved\\nby the words.\\nThe two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow\\nsink. Dawn was spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin,\\ntouching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and\\npenetrating chill left over from the night. There had been a warm wind just\\nbefore dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him\\namong the few troopers remaining in his force.\\nThe man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the\\nsink in the first light of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into\\nthe dunes, his movements barely discernible.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there.\\nIt looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. \"There are many\\nHarkonnen patrols,\" he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the\\ncliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.\\nHawat nodded.\\nMany patrols. Yes.\\nBut still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled. Mentat\\ntraining was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.\\nThis had been the worst night of Hawat\\'s life. He had been at Tsimpo, a\\ngarrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the\\nreports of attack began arriving. At first, he\\'d thought: It\\'s a raid. The\\nHarkonnens are testing.\\nBut report followed report--faster and faster.\\nTwo legions landed at Carthag.\\nFive legions--fifty brigades! --attacking the Duke\\'s main base at Arrakeen.\\nA legion at Arsunt.\\nTwo battle groups at Splintered Rock.\\nThen the reports became more detailed--there were Imperial Sardaukar among\\nthe attackers--possibly two legions of them. And it became clear that the\\ninvaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb\\nIntelligence.\\nHawat\\'s shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning\\nof his Mentat capabilities. The size of the attack struck his mind like a\\nphysical blow.\\nNow, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his\\ntorn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows.\\nThe size of the attack.\\nHe had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the\\nGuild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of\\nHouse-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to\\ntransport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against\\nrandom raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they\\'d expected no more\\nthan ten brigades.\\nBut there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last\\ncount--not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors, crushers, troop-carriers, dump-boxes . . .\\nMore than a hundred brigades--ten legions!\\nThe entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost\\nof such a venture.\\nIt might.\\nI underestimated what the Baron was willing to spend in attacking us, Hawat\\nthought. I failed my Duke.\\nThen there was the matter of the traitor.\\nI will live long enough to see her strangled! he thought. I should\\'ve killed\\nthat Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance. There was no doubt in his mind\\nwho had betrayed them--the Lady Jessica. She fitted all the facts available.\\n\"Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler\\nfriends,\" the Fremen said.\\n\"Good.\"\\nSo Gurney will get off this hell planet. We \\'re not all gone.\\nHawat glanced back at the huddle of his men. He had started the night just\\npast with three hundred of his finest. Of those, an even twenty remained and\\nhalf of them were wounded. Some of them slept now, standing up, leaning against\\nthe rock, sprawled on the sand beneath the rock. Their last \\'thopter, the one\\nthey\\'d been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded, had given\\nout just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces,\\nthen worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin.\\n\\n\\x0cHawat had only a rough idea of their location--some two hundred kilometers\\nsoutheast of Arrakeen. The main traveled ways between the Shield Wall sietch\\ncommunities were somewhere south of them.\\nThe Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal\\nsandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin\\nforehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and\\nmustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by\\npressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.\\nThe man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his\\nnose.\\n\"If you cross the sink here this night,\" the Fremen said, \"you must not use\\nshields. There is a break in the wall . . . \" He turned on his heels, pointed\\nsouth. \" . . . there, and it is open sand down to the erg. Shields will attract\\na . . . \" He hesitated. \". . . worm. They don\\'t often come in here, but a shield\\nwill bring one every time.\"\\nHe said worm, Hawat thought. He was going to say something else. What? And\\nwhat does he want of us?\\nHawat sighed.\\nHe could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness\\nthat energy pills were unable to ease.\\nThose damnable Sardaukar!\\nWith a self-accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldier-fanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented. His own Mentat assessment\\nof the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this\\ntreachery before the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.\\n\"Do you wish to go to the smugglers?\" the Fremen asked.\\n\"Is it possible?\"\\n\"The way is long.\"\\n\"Fremen don\\'t like to say no,\" Idaho had told him once.\\nHawat said: \"You haven\\'t yet told me whether your people can help my\\nwounded.\"\\n\"They are wounded.\"\\nThe same damned answer every time!\\n\"We know they\\'re wounded!\" Hawat snapped. \"That\\'s not the--\"\\n\"Peace, friend,\" the Fremen cautioned. \"What do your wounded say? Are there\\nthose among them who can see the water need of your tribe?\"\\n\"We haven\\'t talked about water,\" Hawat said. \"We--\"\\n\"I can understand your reluctance,\" the Fremen said. \"They are your friends,\\nyour tribesmen. Do you have water?\"\\n\"Not enough.\"\\nThe Fremen gestured to Hawat\\'s tunic, the skin exposed beneath it. \"You were\\ncaught in-sietch, without your suits. You must make a water decision, friend.\"\\n\"Can we hire your help?\"\\nThe Fremen shrugged. \"You have no water.\" He glanced at the group behind\\nHawat. \"How many of your wounded would you spend?\"\\nHawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their\\ncommunication was out of phase. Word-sounds were not being linked up here in the\\nnormal manner.\\n\"I am Thufir Hawat,\" he said. \"I can speak for my Duke. I will make\\npromissory commitment now for your help. I wish a limited form of help,\\npreserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond\\nvengeance.\"\\n\"You wish our siding in a vendetta?\"\\n\"The vendetta I\\'ll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for\\nmy wounded that I may get about it.\"\\n\\n\\x0cThe Fremen scowled. \"How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are\\ntheir own responsibility. The water\\'s at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would you have me\\ntake that decision away from you?\"\\nThe man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.\\nHawat tensed, wondering: Is there betrayal here?\\n\"What do you fear?\" the Fremen demanded.\\nThese people and their disconcerting directness! Hawat spoke cautiously.\\n\"There\\'s a price on my head.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h-h.\" The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. \"You think we have\\nthe Byzantine corruption. You don\\'t know us. The Harkonnens have not water\\nenough to buy the smallest child among us.\"\\nBut they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting\\nships, Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.\\n\"We both fight Harkonnens,\" Hawat said. \"Should we not share the problems\\nand ways of meeting the battle issue?\"\\n\"We are sharing,\" the Fremen said. \"I have seen you fight Harkonnens. You\\nare good. There\\'ve been times I\\'d have appreciated your arm beside me.\"\\n\"Say where my arm may help you,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Who knows?\" the Fremen asked. \"There are Harkonnen forces everywhere. But\\nyou still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded.\"\\nI must be cautious, Hawat told himself. There\\'s a thing here that\\'s not\\nunderstood.\\nHe said: \"Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?\"\\n\"Stranger-thinking,\" the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone. He\\npointed to the northwest across the clifftop. \"We watched you come across the\\nsand last night.\" He lowered his arm. \"You keep your force on the slip-face of\\nthe dunes. Bad. You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long.\"\\n\"The ways of Arrakis don\\'t come easily,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Truth. But we\\'ve killed Harkonnens.\"\\n\"What do you do with your own wounded? \"Hawat demanded.\\n\"Does a man not know when he is worth saving?\" the Fremen asked. \"Your\\nwounded know you have no water.\" He tilted his head, looking sideways up at\\nHawat. \"This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and unwounded\\nmust look to the tribe\\'s future.\"\\nThe tribe\\'s future, Hawat thought. The tribe of Atreides. There\\'s sense in\\nthat. He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.\\n\"Have you word of my Duke or his son?\"\\nUnreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat\\'s. \"Word?\"\\n\"Their fate!\" Hawat snapped.\\n\"Fate is the same for everyone,\" the Fremen said. \"Your Duke, it is said,\\nhas met his fate. As to the Lisan al-Gaib, his son, that is in Liet\\'s hands.\\nLiet has not said.\"\\nI knew the answer without asking, Hawat thought.\\nHe glanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard. They\\nwere staring out across the sand, the realization in their expressions: there\\nwas no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.\\nHawat turned back to the Fremen. \"Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?\"\\n\"He was in the great house when the shield went down,\" the Fremen said.\\n\"This I\\'ve heard . . . no more.\"\\nShe dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens, he thought. I was the one\\nwho sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it meant turning also\\nagainst her own son? But . . . who knows how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks . . .\\nif you can call it thinking?\\nHawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. \"When will you hear about the boy?\"\\n\"We know little of what happens in Arrakeen,\" the Fremen said. He shrugged.\\n\"Who knows?\"\\n\"You have ways of finding out?\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Perhaps.\" The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose. \"Tell me, Thufir\\nHawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons the Harkonnens used?\"\\nThe artillery, Hawat thought bitterly. Who could have guessed they\\'d use\\nartillery in this day of shields?\\n\"You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves,\" he\\nsaid. \"I\\'ve . . . theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons.\"\\n\"Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to\\ndie,\" the Fremen said.\\n\"Why do you ask about these weapons?\"\\n\"Liet wishes it.\"\\nIs that what he wants from us? Hawat wondered. He said: \"Did you come here\\nseeking information about the big guns?\"\\n\"Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.\"\\n\"Then you should just go take one,\" Hawat sneered.\\n\"Yes,\" the Fremen said. \"We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar can\\nstudy it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he wishes. But I\\ndoubt he\\'ll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for\\nArrakis.\"\\n\"You . . . took one?\" Hawat asked.\\n\"It was a good fight,\" the Fremen said. \"We lost only two men and spilled\\nthe water from more than a hundred of theirs.\"\\nThere were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks\\ncasually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!\\n\"We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the\\nHarkonnens,\" the Fremen said. \"Some of those are good fighters.\"\\nOne of Hawat\\'s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. \"Are\\nyou talking about Sardaukar?\"\\n\"He\\'s talking about Sardaukar,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Sardaukar!\" the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice.\\n\"Ah-h-h, so that\\'s what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which\\nlegion? Do you know?\"\\n\"We . . . don\\'t know,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Sardaukar,\" the Fremen mused. \"Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that\\nnot strange?\"\\n\"The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,\" Hawat\\nsaid.\\n\"But you know they are Sardaukar.\"\\n\"Who am I?\" Hawat asked bitterly.\\n\"You are Thufir Hawat,\" the man said matter-of-factly. \"Well, we would have\\nlearned it in time. We\\'ve sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet\\'s\\nmen.\"\\nHawat\\'s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: \"You . . . captured\\nSardaukar?\"\\n\"Only three of them,\" the Fremen said. \"They fought well.\"\\nIf only we\\'d had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought. It\\nwas a sour lament in his mind. If only we could\\'ve trained them and armed them.\\nGreat Mother, what a fighting force we\\'d have had!\\n\"Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,\" the Fremen\\nsaid. \"If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend\\nthoughts on a matter which has not been proved.\"\\n\"I serve the . . . Lisan al-Gaib,\" Hawat said. \"His welfare is my concern.\\nI\\'ve pledged myself to this.\"\\n\"You are pledged to his water?\"\\nHawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his\\nattention to the squatting figure. \"To his water, yes.\"\\n\"You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?\"\\n\"To . . . yes, to the place of his water.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?\" The Fremen stood up,\\nseated his nose plugs firmly.\\nHawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a\\ntired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among\\nthe men.\\nThe Fremen said: \"There is always a way to water.\"\\nBehind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat\\'s aide called: \"Thufir! Arkie just died.\"\\nThe Fremen put a fist to his ear. \"The bond of water! It\\'s a sign!\" He\\nstared at Hawat. \"We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall I call\\nmy men?\"\\nThe aide returned to Hawat\\'s side, said: \"Thufir, a couple of the men left\\nwives in Arrakeen. They\\'re . . . well, you know how it is at a time like this.\"\\nThe Fremen still held his fist to his ear. \"Is it the bond of water, Thufir\\nHawat?\" he demanded.\\nHawat\\'s mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen\\'s words,\\nbut feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they\\nunderstood it.\\n\"The bond of water,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Let our tribes be joined,\" the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.\\nAs though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the\\nrocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a\\nloose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the\\nright. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.\\nIt was over before Hawat\\'s tired men could gather their wits. The group with\\nthe body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the\\ncliff.\\nOne of Hawat\\'s men shouted: \"Where they going with Arkie? He was--\"\\n\"They\\'re taking him to . . . bury him,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Fremen don\\'t bury their dead!\" the man barked. \"Don\\'t you try any tricks on\\nus, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of--\"\\n\"Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib,\" the\\nFremen said. \"If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why\\nraise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as\\nlong as the memory of man endures.\"\\nBut Hawat\\'s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a\\nlasgun. He started to draw it.\\n\"Stop right where you are!\" Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue\\nthat gripped his muscles. \"These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but\\nthe meaning\\'s the same.\"\\n\"They\\'re going to render Arkie down for his water,\" the man with the lasgun\\nsnarled.\\n\"Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?\" the Fremen asked.\\nHe doesn\\'t even see the problem, Hawat thought. The naivete of the Fremen\\nwas frightening.\\n\"They\\'re concerned for a respected comrade,\" Hawat said.\\n\"We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,\" the\\nFremen said. \"This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man\\'s flesh is his\\nown; the water belongs to the tribe.\"\\nHawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. \"Will\\nyou now help our wounded?\"\\n\"One does not question the bond,\" the Fremen said. \"We will do for you what\\na tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and see to the\\nnecessities.\"\\nThe man with the lasgun hesitated.\\nHawat\\'s aide said: \"Are we buying help with Arkie\\'s . . . water?\"\\n\"Not buying,\" Hawat said. \"We\\'ve joined these people.\"\\n\"Customs differ,\" one of his men muttered.\\n\\n\\x0cHawat began to relax.\\n\"And they\\'ll help us get to Arrakeen?\"\\n\"We will kill Harkonnens,\" the Fremen said. He grinned. \"And Sardaukar.\" He\\nstepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back,\\nlistening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: \"An aircraft comes. Conceal\\nyourselves beneath the rock and remain\\' motionless.\"\\nAt a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.\\nThe Fremen took Hawat\\'s arm, pressed him back with the others. \"We will\\nfight in the time of fighting,\" the man said. He reached beneath his robes,\\nbrought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.\\nHawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.\\nThe Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the\\nanimal\\'s head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bat\\'s\\nupturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen\\'s opened\\nhand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat\\'s head and chattered into\\nthe tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.\\nThe bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.\\nThe Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his\\nhead, listening. \"They quarter the high country,\" he said. \"One wonders who they\\nseek up there.\"\\n\"It\\'s known that we retreated in this direction,\" Hawat said.\\n\"One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,\" the Fremen\\nsaid. \"Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.\"\\nTime passed.\\nSome of Hawat\\'s men stirred, whispering.\\n\"Remain silent as frightened animals,\" the Fremen hissed.\\nHawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff--flitting blurs of tan on\\ntan.\\n\"My little friend carried his message,\" the Fremen said. \"He is a good\\nmessenger--day or night. I\\'ll be unhappy to lose that one.\"\\nThe movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five\\nkilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of the day\\'s\\nheat--blurred columns of rising air.\\n\"Be most silent now,\" the Fremen whispered.\\nA file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff,\\nheaded directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a\\ncuriously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the\\ndunes.\\nA \"thwok-thwok\" of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind\\nHawat\\'s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them--an Atreides\\n\\'thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The \\'thopter swooped\\ntoward the men crossing the sink.\\nThe group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.\\nThe \\'thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the \\'thopter and\\nHawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of shields and, in their motions, the\\nhard competence of Sardaukar.\\n\"Aiihh! They use their stupid shields,\" the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He\\nglanced toward the open south wall of the sink.\\n\"They are Sardaukar,\" Hawat whispered.\\n\"Good.\"\\nThe Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group,\\napparently indifferent.\\n\\n\\x0cAbruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the\\nornithopter, then in it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust\\ncloud partly obscured violent motion.\\nPresently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.\\n\"They left only three men in their \\'thopter,\" the Fremen beside Hawat said.\\n\"That was fortunate. I don\\'t believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.\"\\nBehind Hawat, one of his men whispered: \"Those were Sardaukar!\"\\n\"Did you notice how well they fought?\" the Fremen asked.\\nHawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the\\nheat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: \"Yes, they fought\\nwell, indeed.\"\\nThe captured \\'thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward\\nto the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\\nSo these Fremen can handle \\'thopters, too, Hawat thought.\\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once . . .\\ntwice.\\n\"More come!\" the Fremen beside Hawat barked. \"Be ready. I\\'d hoped to have us\\naway without more inconvenience.\"\\nInconvenience! Hawat thought.\\nHe saw two more \\'thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of\\nsand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue--the bodies\\nof the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms--remained at the scene of violence.\\nAnother \\'thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a\\nsharp breath as he saw it--a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load--like a giant bird coming to its nest.\\nIn the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the\\ndiving \\'thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.\\n\"The cowards!\" the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.\\nThe troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue-clad bodies. Its wings\\ncrept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.\\nHawat\\'s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a\\n\\'thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides,\\nits jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky. It plunged\\nlike an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the\\nlasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving \\'thopter\\nplunged.\\nA flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all\\naround. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and\\nits companion \\'thopters had been--everything there caught in the flame.\\nIt was the Fremen who took off in that captured \\'thopter, Hawat thought. He\\ndeliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are\\nthese Fremen?\\n\"A reasonable exchange,\" said the Fremen beside Hawat. \"There must\\'ve been\\nthree hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and make\\nplans to get another aircraft.\" He started to step out of their rock-shadowed\\nconcealment.\\nA rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in\\nlow-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they\\nwere Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and\\neach carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.\\nA thrown knife caught Hawat\\'s Fremen companion in the throat, hurting him\\nbackward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before\\nblackness of a stunner projectile felled him.\\n', 26: '\\n\\n\\x0cMuad\\'Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of\\nthis power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you\\nare on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so,\\nMuad\\'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells\\nus that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word\\nover another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us \"The\\nvision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow\\ndoor.\" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course,\\nwarning \"That path leads ever down into stagnation.\"\\n-from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\\nAs the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his\\nmother\\'s arm, snapped: \"Don\\'t move!\"\\nThen he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to\\nbrake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.\\n\"It\\'s Idaho,\" he breathed.\\nThe craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds\\ncoming to nest. Idaho was out of his \\'thopter and running toward them before the\\ndust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the\\ntall, sandy-bearded Kynes.\\n\"This way!\" Kynes called and he veered left.\\nBehind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their\\nornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.\\nIdaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. \"M\\'Lord, the Fremen have\\na temporary hiding place nearby where we--\"\\n\"What about that back there?\"\\nPaul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff--the jet flares, the\\npurple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.\\nA rare smile touched Idaho\\'s round, placid face. \"M\\'Lord . . . Sire, I\\'ve\\nleft them a little sur--\"\\nGlaring white light filled the desert--bright as a sun, etching their\\nshadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had\\nPaul\\'s arm in one hand, Jessica\\'s shoulder in the other, hurling them down off\\nthe ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an\\nexplosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge\\nthey had vacated.\\nIdaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.\\n\"Not the family atomics!\" Jessica said. \"I thought--\"\\n\"You planted a shield back there,\" Paul said.\\n\"A big one turned to full force,\" Idaho said. \"A lasgun beam touched it and\\n. . . \" He shrugged.\\n\"Subatomic fusion,\" Jessica said. \"That\\'s a dangerous weapon.\"\\n\"Not weapon, m\\'Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using\\nlasguns another time.\"\\nThe Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low\\nvoice: \"We should get under cover, friends.\"\\nPaul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.\\n\"That blast will attract considerable attention, Sire,\" Idaho said.\\nSire, Paul thought.\\nThe word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been\\nhis father.\\nHe felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself\\ninfected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe\\ntoward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him\\nalong the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a\\nway down into the sand with their compaction tools.\\n\"May I take your pack, Sire?\" Idaho asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"It\\'s not heavy, Duncan,\" Paul said.\\n\"You have no body shield,\" Idaho said. \"Do you wish mine?\" He glanced at the\\ndistant cliff. \"Not likely there\\'ll be any more lasgun activity about.\"\\n\"Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me.\"\\nJessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul,\\nand she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.\\nThe Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native\\nbasement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.\\n\"This way,\" one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into\\ndarkness.\\nBehind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came\\nalive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed\\nFremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner,\\nfound another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.\\nKynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit\\nglistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue\\neyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.\\nIn the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping\\nthese people? It\\'s the most dangerous thing I\\'ve ever done. It could doom me\\nwith them.\\nThen he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle\\nof manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be\\nassumed--the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still\\nexisted and solely because of this youth--and this was not a thing to be taken\\nlightly.\\nJessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the\\nBene Gesserit way--a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the\\nancient manner.\\n\"This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as\\nadvance bases,\" Paul said.\\nHis father wanted! Kynes thought.\\nAnd again Kynes wondered at himself. Am I foolish to aid these fugitives?\\nWhy am I doing it? It\\'d be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust\\nwith them.\\nPaul followed his mother\\'s example, gestalting the room, seeing the\\nworkbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the\\nbench--dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them.\\nAn ozone smell permeated the place.\\nSome of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new\\nsounds started there--machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and\\nmultidrives.\\nPaul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them\\nstacked against the wall.\\n\"You\\'ve recognized this place correctly,\" Kynes said. \"For what would you\\nuse such a place, Paul Atreides?\"\\n\"To make this planet a fit place for humans,\" Paul said.\\nPerhaps that\\'s why I help them, Kynes thought.\\nThe machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there\\ncame a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in\\nembarrassment.\\nPaul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.\\nA Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: \"Liet,\\nthe field-generator equipment is not working. I am unable to mask us from\\nproximity detectors.\"\\n\"Can you repair it?\" Kynes asked.\\n\"Not quickly. The parts . . . \" The man shrugged.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Yes,\" Kynes said. \"Then we\\'ll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air\\nout to the surface.\"\\n\"Immediately.\" The man hurried away.\\nKynes turned back to Paul. \"You gave a good answer.\"\\nJessica marked the easy rumble of the man\\'s voice. It was a royal voice,\\naccustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet\\nwas the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.\\n\"We\\'re most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,\" she said.\\n\"Mm-m-m, we\\'ll see,\" Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. \"Spice coffee\\nin my quarters, Shamir.\"\\n\"At once, Liet,\" the man said.\\nKynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. \"If you\\nplease?\"\\nJessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a\\nhand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here.\\nThe passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square\\noffice lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door as\\nshe entered, was startled to identify plasteel.\\nPaul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He\\nheard the door close behind him, studied the place--about eight meters to a\\nside, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on\\ntheir right. A low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied\\nthe room\\'s center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.\\nKynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the\\nway her son examined the room.\\nPaul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room\\'s\\nair currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing\\ncabinets.\\n\"Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?\" Kynes asked.\\nHow carefully he avoids my title, Paul thought. But he accepted the chair,\\nremained silent while Kynes sat down.\\n\"You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise,\" Kynes said. \"Yet, as you see,\\nthe Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the\\nspice!\"\\nPaul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. \"Do you see this ring?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Do you know its significance?\"\\nJessica turned sharply to stare at her son.\\n\"Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen,\" Kynes said. \"You are\\ntechnically the Duke.\"\\n\"I\\'m a soldier of the Imperium,\" Paul said, \"technically a hatchetman.\"\\nKynes face darkened. \"Even with the Emperor\\'s Sardaukar standing over your\\nfather\\'s body?\"\\n\"The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another,\"\\nPaul said.\\n\"Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority,\"\\nKynes said.\\nAnd Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: There\\'s steel in this man\\nthat no one has taken the temper out of . . . and we\\'ve need of steel. Paul\\'s\\ndoing a dangerous thing.\\nPaul said: \"The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved\\nEmperor feared my father. Now, I will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear\\nthe--\"\\n\"Lad,\" Kynes said, \"there are things you don\\'t--\"\\n\"You will address me as Sire or my Lord,\" Paul said.\\nGently, Jessica thought.\\n\\n\\x0cKynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the\\nplanetologist\\'s face, the touch of humor there.\\n\"Sire,\" Kynes said.\\n\"I am an embarrassment to the Emperor,\" Paul said. \"I am an embarrassment to\\nall who would divide Arrakis as their spoil. As I live, I shall continue to be\\nsuch an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!\"\\n\"Words,\" Kynes said.\\nPaul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: \"You have a legend of the Lisan\\nal-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen\\nto paradise. Your men have--\"\\n\"Superstition!\" Kynes said.\\n\"Perhaps, \"Paul agreed. \"Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have\\nstrange roots and stranger branchings.\"\\n\"You have a plan,\" Kynes said. \"This much is obvious . . . Sire.\"\\n\"Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are\\nhere in Harkonnen uniform?\"\\n\"Quite likely.\"\\n\"The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here,\" Paul said. \"Perhaps\\neven Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his\\nguilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before\\nthe Landsraad. Let him answer there where--\"\\n\"Paul!\" Jessica said.\\n\"Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case,\" Kynes said,\\n\"there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the\\nGreat Houses.\"\\n\"Chaos,\" Jessica said.\\n\"But I\\'d present my case to the Emperor,\" Paul said, \"and give him an\\nalternative to chaos.\"\\nJessica spoke in a dry tone: \"Blackmail?\"\\n\"One of the tools of statecraft, as you\\'ve said yourself,\" Paul said, and\\nJessica heard the bitterness in his voice. \"The Emperor has no sons, only\\ndaughters.\"\\n\"You\\'d aim for the throne?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war,\" Paul\\nsaid. \"Planets blasted, disorder everywhere--he\\'ll not risk that.\"\\n\"This is a desperate gamble you propose,\" Kynes said.\\n\"What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?\" Paul asked. \"They\\nfear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis--the Sardaukar picking\\nthem off one by one. That\\'s why there is a Landsraad. This is the glue of the\\nGreat Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.\"\\n\"But they\\'re--\"\\n\"This is what they fear,\" Paul said. \"Arrakis would become a rallying cry.\\nEach of them would see himself in my father--cut out of the herd and killed.\"\\nKynes spoke to Jessica: \"Would his plan work?\"\\n\"I\\'m no Mentat,\" Jessica said.\\n\"But you are Bene Gesserit.\"\\nShe shot a probing stare at him, said: \"His plan has good points and bad\\npoints . . . as any plan would at this stage. A plan depends as much upon\\nexecution as it does upon concept.\"\\n\" \\'Law is the ultimate science,\\' \" Paul quoted. \"Thus it reads above the\\nEmperor\\'s door. I propose to show him law.\"\\n\"And I\\'m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,\" Kynes\\nsaid. \"Arrakis has its own plan that we--\"\\n\"From the throne,\" Paul said, \"I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the\\nwave of a hand. This is the coin I offer for your support.\"\\nKynes stiffened. \"My loyalty\\'s not for sale, Sire.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh\\nsmile touched Paul\\'s lips and he said: \"Well spoken. I apologize.\"\\nKynes met Paul\\'s stare and, presently, said: \"No Harkonnen ever admitted\\nerror. Perhaps you\\'re not like them, Atreides.\"\\n\"It could be a fault in their education,\" Paul said. \"You say you\\'re not for\\nsale, but I believe I\\'ve the coin you\\'ll accept. For your loyalty I offer my\\nloyalty to you . . . totally.\"\\nMy son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought. He has that tremendous,\\nalmost naive honor--and what a powerful force that truly is.\\nShe saw that Paul\\'s words had shaken Kynes.\\n\"This is nonsense,\" Kynes said. \"You\\'re just a boy and--\"\\n\"I\\'m the Duke,\" Paul said. \"I\\'m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken\\nsuch a bond.\"\\nKynes swallowed.\\n\"When I say totally,\" Paul said, \"I mean without reservation. I would give\\nmy life for you.\"\\n\"Sire!\" Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he\\nwas not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes\\nmeant the word.\\nIn this moment he\\'d give his life for Paul, she thought. How do the Atreides\\naccomplish this thing so quickly, so easily?\\n\"I know you mean this,\" Kynes said. \"Yet the Harkon--\"\\nThe door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence-shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing in the passage.\\nWith his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking\\nthe passage, his blood-pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw\\nhands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the\\norange fire-mouth of a stunner repelled by the shield. Idaho\\'s blades were\\nthrough it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.\\nThen Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.\\nPaul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen\\nuniforms--his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red\\nblossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes\\nthrew the bolts.\\n\"I appear to\\'ve decided,\" Kynes said.\\n\"Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down,\" Paul said. He\\npulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.\\n\"I should\\'ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,\" Kynes\\nsaid.\\n\"You\\'ve a bolt hole out of here,\" Paul said. \"Shall we use it?\"\\nKynes took a deep breath, said: \"This door should hold for at least twenty\\nminutes against all but a lasgun.\"\\n\"They\\'ll not use a lasgun for fear we\\'ve shields on this side,\" Paul said.\\n\"Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,\" Jessica whispered.\\nThey could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.\\nKynes indicated the cabinets against the right-hand wall, said: \"This way.\"\\nHe crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within\\nit. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a\\ntunnel. \"This door also is plasteel,\" Kynes said.\\n\"You were well prepared,\" Jessica said.\\n\"We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,\" Kynes said. He herded them\\ninto the darkness, closed the door.\\nIn the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of\\nher.\\nKynes\\' voice came from behind them: \"We\\'ll separate here. This wall is\\ntougher. It\\'ll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that one on\\n\\n\\x0cthe floor. They\\'ll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to\\nanother exit where I\\'ve secreted a \\'thopter. There\\'s a storm across the desert\\ntonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride\\nwith it. My people have done this in stealing \\'thopters. If you stay high in the\\nstorm you\\'ll survive.\"\\n\"What of you?\" Paul asked.\\n\"I\\'ll try to escape another way. If I\\'m captured . . . well, I\\'m still\\nImperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive.\"\\nRunning like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can I live to avenge my\\nfather? He turned to face the door.\\nJessica heard him move, said \"Duncan\\'s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You\\ncan do nothing for him.\"\\n\"I\\'ll take full payment for them all one day,\" Paul said.\\n\"Not unless you hurry now,\" Kynes said.\\nPaul felt the man\\'s hand on his shoulder.\\n\"Where will we meet, Kynes?\" Paul asked.\\n\"I\\'ll send Fremen searching for you. The storm\\'s path is known. Hurry now,\\nand the Great Mother give you speed and luck.\"\\nThey heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.\\nJessica found Paul\\'s hand, pulled him gently. \"We must not get separated,\"\\nshe said.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nHe followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched\\nit. Another arrow beckoned ahead.\\nThey crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.\\nThey were running now.\\nPlans within plans within plans within plans, Jessica thought. Have we\\nbecome part of someone else\\'s plan now?\\nThe arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in\\nthe faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up.\\nThey came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing\\nwall with a dark handle visible in its center.\\nPaul pressed the handle.\\nThe wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern\\nwith an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a doorsign on\\nit loomed beyond the aircraft.\\n\"Where did Kynes go?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"He did what any good guerrilla leader would,\" Paul said. \"He separated us\\ninto two parties and arranged that he couldn\\'t reveal where we are if he\\'s\\ncaptured. He won\\'t really know.\"\\nPaul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the\\nfloor.\\n\"No one\\'s been here for a long time,\" he said.\\n\"He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,\" she said.\\n\"I share that confidence.\"\\nPaul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter\\'s left door, opened it,\\nand secured his pack in the rear. \"This ship\\'s proximity masked,\" he said.\\n\"Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the\\nHarkonnens taught them to be thorough.\"\\nJessica leaned against the craft\\'s other side, catching her breath.\\n\"The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area,\" she said.\\n\"They\\'re not stupid.\" She considered her direction sense, pointed right. \"The\\nstorm we saw is that way.\"\\nPaul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but\\nfound no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the\\nhere-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself\\n\\n\\x0cfrom a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless paths up\\nout of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many\\nwould not.\\n\"The longer we wait the better prepared they\\'ll be,\" Jessica said.\\n\"Get in and strap yourself down,\" he said.\\nHe joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this\\nwas blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt\\nsense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient\\nmemory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.\\n\"If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.\" It was a Bene\\nGesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into\\nthat trap . . . if he lived through this.\\nPaul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked\\nthe aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate metal\\ninterleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten\\nfor jet-boost take-off the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch\\nmoved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were\\narmed. Turbines began their low hissing.\\n\"Ready?\" he asked.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nHe touched the remote control for lights.\\nDarkness blanketed them.\\nHis hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote\\ndoor control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand swished away to\\nsilence. A dusty breeze touched Paul\\'s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the\\nsudden pressure.\\nA wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where\\nthe door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand\\nripples.\\nPaul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings\\nsnapped back and down, hurling the \\'thopter out of its nest. Power surged from\\nthe jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.\\nJessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the\\nsureness of her son\\'s movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated. Now,\\nPaul\\'s training is our only hope, she thought. His youth and swiftness.\\nPaul fed more power to the jetpods. The \\'thopter banked, sinking them into\\ntheir seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave the craft\\nmore wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over\\nrocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining\\nthe ribbon trail of the storm.\\nPaul\\'s hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. G-force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.\\n\"Jetflares behind us!\" Jessica said.\\n\"I saw them.\"\\nHe slammed the power arm forward.\\nTheir \\'thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the\\nstorm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw scattered\\nshadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking\\nbeneath the dunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows--dunes\\ndiminishing one into another.\\nAnd above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall\\nagainst the stars.\\nSomething jarred the \\'thopter.\\n\"Shellburst!\" Jessica gasped. \"They\\'re using some kind of projectile\\nweapon.\"\\n\\n\\x0cShe saw a sudden animal grin on Paul\\'s face. \"They seem to be avoiding their\\nlasguns,\" he said.\\n\"But we\\'ve no shields!\"\\n\"Do they know that?\"\\nAgain the \\'thopter shuddered.\\nPaul twisted to peer back. \"Only one of them appears to be fast enough to\\nkeep up with us.\"\\nHe returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high\\nin front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.\\n\"Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry--that\\'s one thing\\nwe\\'ll give the Fremen,\" Paul whispered.\\n\"The storm,\" Jessica said. \"Hadn\\'t you better turn?\"\\n\"What about the ship behind us?\"\\n\"He\\'s pulling up.\"\\n\"Now!\"\\nPaul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling\\nof the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.\\nThey appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and\\nheavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft became a\\nlong, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the\\ninstrument panel.\\nThrough Jessica\\'s mind flashed all the warnings about such storms--that they\\ncut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones. She felt the\\nbuffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls.\\nShe saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and\\ntrembled.\\n\"Sand!\" Jessica shouted.\\nShe saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. \"Not\\nmuch sand this high.\"\\nBut she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.\\nPaul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the\\nstrain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting\\nfor altitude.\\nThe sound of their passage diminished.\\nThe \\'thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing\\nglobe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.\\nJessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion\\nwas external. A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded\\nher of the powers around them.\\nWinds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour, she thought. Adrenaline\\nedginess gnawed at her. I must not fear, she told herself, mouthing the words of\\nthe Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer.\\nSlowly her long years of training prevailed.\\nCalmness returned.\\n\"We have the tiger by the tail,\" Paul whispered. \"We can\\'t go down, can\\'t\\nland . . . and I don\\'t think I can lift us out of this. We\\'ll have to ride it\\nout.\"\\nCalmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them\\ntogether. Then she heard Paul\\'s voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:\\n\"Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total\\nobliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through\\nme. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear\\'s path. Where the fear\\nhas gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\"\\n', 27: '\\nWhat do you despise? By this are you truly known.\\n\\n\\x0c-from \"Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"They are dead, Baron,\" said Iakin Nefud, the guard captain. \"Both the woman\\nand the boy are certainly dead.\"\\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private\\nquarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multi-shelled egg\\nstretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters,\\nthough, the ship\\'s harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric\\npaddings and rare art objects.\\n\"It is a certainty,\" the guard captain said. \"They are dead.\"\\nThe Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his attention on\\nan ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from\\nhim. He straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck,\\nstared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where\\nCaptain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\\n\"They\\'re certainly dead, Baron,\" the man repeated.\\nThe Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud\\'s eyes. It was obvious\\nthe man had been deep within the drug\\'s rapture when he received this report,\\nand had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.\\n\"I have a full report,\" Nefud said.\\nLet him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of\\nstatecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear--sharp and ready.\\n\"Have you seen their bodies?\" the Baron rumbled.\\nNefud hesitated.\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"M\\'Lord . . . they were seen to dive into a sandstorm . . . winds over eight\\nhundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m\\'Lord. Nothing! One of our\\nown craft was destroyed in the pursuit.\"\\nThe Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of\\nthe man\\'s jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.\\n\"You have seen the bodies?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"M\\'Lord--\"\\n\"For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?\" the Baron roared.\\n\"To tell me a thing is certain when it is not? Do you think I\\'ll praise you for\\nsuch stupidity, give you another promotion?\"\\nNefud\\'s face went bone pale.\\nLook at the chicken, the Baron thought. I am surrounded by such useless\\nclods. If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he\\'d\\npeek at it.\\n\"The man Idaho led us to them, then?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord!\"\\nLook how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought. He said: \"They were\\nattempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Is there more to this . . . report?\"\\n\"The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, m\\'Lord. Idaho joined this\\nKynes under mysterious circumstances . . . I might even say suspicious\\ncircumstances.\"\\n\"So?\"\\n\"They . . . ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it\\'s apparent\\nthe boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement of the chase, several of\\nour groups were caught in a lasgun-shield explosion.\"\\n\"How many did we lose?\"\\n\"I\\'m . . . ah, not sure yet, m\\'Lord.\"\\nHe\\'s lying, the Baron thought. It must\\'ve been pretty bad.\\n\"The Imperial lackey, this Kynes,\" the Baron said. \"He was playing a double\\ngame, eh?\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"I\\'d stake my reputation on it, m\\'Lord.\"\\nHis reputation!\\n\"Have the man killed,\" the Baron said.\\n\"M\\'Lord! Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majesty\\'s own serv--\"\\n\"Make it look like an accident, then!\"\\n\"M\\'Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this\\nFremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now.\"\\n\"Get him away from them. Say I wish to question him.\"\\n\"If they demur?\"\\n\"They will not if you handle it correctly.\"\\nNefud swallowed. \"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"The man must die,\" the Baron rumbled. \"He tried to help my enemies.\"\\nNefud shifted from one foot to the other.\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"M\\'Lord, the Sardaukar have . . . two persons in custody who might be of\\ninterest to you. They\\'ve caught the Duke\\'s Master of Assassins.\"\\n\"Hawat? Thufir Hawat?\"\\n\"I\\'ve seen the captive myself, m\\'Lord. \\'Tis Hawat.\"\\n\"I\\'d not\\'ve believed it possible!\"\\n\"They say he was knocked out by a stunner, m\\'Lord. In the desert where he\\ncouldn\\'t use his shield. He\\'s virtually unharmed. If we can get our hands on\\nhim, he\\'ll provide great sport.\"\\n\"This is a Mentat you speak of,\" the Baron growled. \"One doesn\\'t waste a\\nMentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat? Could he know the extent\\nof . . . but no.\"\\n\"He has spoken only enough, m\\'Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady\\nJessica was his betrayer.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h-h-h.\"\\nThe Baron sank back, thinking; then: \"You\\'re sure? It\\'s the Lady Jessica who\\nattracts his anger?\"\\n\"He said it in my presence, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Let him think she\\'s alive, then.\"\\n\"But, m\\'Lord--\"\\n\"Be quiet. I wish Hawat treated kindly. He must be told nothing of the late\\nDoctor Yueh, his true betrayer. Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending\\nhis Duke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, feed his suspicions\\nagainst the Lady Jessica.\"\\n\"M\\'Lord, I don\\'t--\"\\n\"The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information.\\nFalse information--false results.\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord, but . . . \"\\n\"Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?\"\\n\"M\\'Lord, Hawat\\'s still in the hands of the Sardaukar!\"\\n\"Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information\\nfrom Hawat as I am. I\\'ve noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud. They\\'re not\\nvery devious . . .politically. I do believe this is a deliberate thing; the\\nEmperor wants it that way. Yes. I do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar\\ncommander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.\"\\nNefud looked unhappy. \"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"You will tell the Sardaukar commander that I wish to question both Hawat\\nand this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other. He can\\nunderstand that much, I think.\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"And once we have them in our hands . . . \" The Baron nodded.\\n\"M\\'Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any . . .\\nquestioning.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"I\\'m sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers,\\nNefud.\"\\n\"I understand, m\\'Lord. That\\'s when Kynes can have his accident.\"\\n\"Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will\\nhave a real accident. It\\'s Hawat I want. Yes. Ah, yes.\"\\nNefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained\\nsilent.\\n\"Hawat will be given both food and drink,\" the Baron said. \"Treated with\\nkindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer the residual poison\\ndeveloped by the late Piter de Vries. And you will see that the antidote becomes\\na regular part of Hawat\\'s diet from this point on . . . unless I say otherwise.\"\\n\"The antidote, yes.\" Nefud shook his head. \"But--\"\\n\"Don\\'t be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule\\ntooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable\\nMentat, Piter. I need a replacement.\"\\n\"Hawat?\"\\n\"Hawat.\"\\n\"But--\"\\n\"You\\'re going to say Hawat\\'s completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the\\nAtreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he\\'s not to blame for\\nthe Duke\\'s demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an\\ninferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the\\nability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable Thufir\\nHawat.\"\\n\"Woo him. Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could\\nnot elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat\\'s\\nright. Hawat will see a certain element of truth in this. The Duke couldn\\'t\\nafford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required\\ninformation.\" The Baron stared at Nefud. \"Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud.\\nThe truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat\\nknows, too. We did it with wealth.\"\\n\"With wealth. Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"We will woo Hawat,\" the Baron said. \"We will hide him from the Sardaukar.\\nAnd we will hold in reserve . . . the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison.\\nThere\\'s no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never\\nsuspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan\\nhis food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.\"\\nNefud\\'s eyes opened wide with understanding.\\n\"The absence of a thing,\" the Baron said, \"this can be as deadly as the\\npresence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything\\nelse we\\'re addicted to.\" The Baron nodded. \"You understand me, Nefud?\"\\nNefud swallowed. \"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\nThen get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.\"\\n\"At once, m\\'Lord.\" Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.\\nHawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If\\nthey suspect anything at all it\\'s that I wish to destroy the Mentat. And this\\nsuspicion I\\'ll confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all\\nhistory, a Mentat trained to kill, and they\\'ll toss him to me like some silly\\ntoy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.\\nThe Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed, pressed a\\nbutton to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.\\nAnd all the Atreides dead!\\nThe stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing\\nsurvived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter . . .\\nor its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right\\nplaces, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down\\n\\n\\x0conto one planet . . . all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor\\'s ears alone,\\nall the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.\\nPower and fear--fear and power!\\nThe Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be\\nEmperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this\\nRabban he\\'d summoned, of course. But Rabban\\'s younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed . . . a\\nferocity.\\nA lovely boy, the Baron thought. A year or two more--say, by the time he\\'s\\nseventeen, I\\'ll know for certain whether he\\'s the tool that House Harkonnen\\nrequires to gain the throne.\\n\"M\\'Lord Baron.\"\\nThe man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron\\'s bedchamber was low\\nbuilt, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line\\'s narrow-set\\neyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some rigidity in his fat, but it was\\nobvious to the eye that he\\'d come one day to the portable suspensors for\\ncarrying his excess weight.\\nA muscle-minded tank-brain, the Baron thought. No Mentat, my nephew . . .\\nnot a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task\\nat hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he\\'ll grind over everything in his\\npath. Oh, how he\\'ll be hated here on Arrakis!\\n\"My dear Rabban,\" the Baron said. He released the doorfield, but pointedly\\nkept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be\\nvisible above the bedside glowglobe.\\n\"You summoned me,\" Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance\\npast the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a suspensor chair,\\nfound none.\\n\"Stand closer where I can see you easily,\" the Baron said.\\nRabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had\\ndeliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.\\n\"The Atreides are dead,\" the Baron said. \"The last of them. That\\'s why I\\nsummoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again yours.\"\\nRabban blinked. \"But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to\\nthe--\"\\n\"Piter, too, is dead.\"\\n\"Piter?\"\\n\"Piter.\"\\nThe Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy\\npenetration.\\n\"You finally tired of him, eh?\" Rabban asked.\\nHis voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy-blanketed room.\\n\"I will say a thing to you just this once,\" the Baron rumbled. \"You\\ninsinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle.\" He snapped fat\\nfingers. \"Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. I will take it\\nunkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that I am so stupid.\"\\nFear showed in the squinting of Rabban\\'s eyes. He knew within certain limits\\nhow far the old Baron would go against family. Seldom to the point of death\\nunless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments\\ncould be painful.\\n\"Forgive me, m\\'Lord Baron,\" Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide\\nhis own anger as to show subservience.\\n\"You do not fool me, Rabban,\" the Baron said.\\nRabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.\\n\"I make a point,\" the Baron said. \"Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the\\nway an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for\\nan overriding purpose--and know your purpose!\"\\n\\n\\x0cAnger spoke in Rabban: \"But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his\\nbody being carried out as I arrived last night.\"\\nRabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.\\nBut the Baron smiled. \"I\\'m very careful about dangerous weapons,\" he said.\\n\"Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke.\" Strength poured into the\\nBaron\\'s voice. \"I suborned a doctor of the Suk School! The Inner School! You\\nhear, boy? But that\\'s a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. I didn\\'t\\nobliterate him casually.\"\\n\"Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?\"\\nThis was a penetrating question, the Baron thought. Have I misjudged this\\nnephew?\\n\"The Emperor doesn\\'t know it yet,\" the Baron said. \"But his Sardaukar are\\nsure to report it to him. Before that happens, though, I\\'ll have my own report\\nin his hands through CHOAM Company channels. I will explain that I luckily\\ndiscovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you\\nunderstand? Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk\\nSchool, this will be accepted.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h, I see,\" Rabban murmured.\\nAnd the Baron thought: Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how\\nvital it is that this remain secret. The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. Why\\ndid I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine--the nephew I must\\nuse and discard? The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.\\n\"It must be kept secret,\" Rabban said. \"I understand.\"\\nThe Baron sighed. \"I give you different instructions about Arrakis this\\ntime, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein. This\\ntime, I have only one requirement.\"\\n\"M\\'Lord?\"\\n\"Income.\"\\n\"Income?\"\\n\"Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force\\nto bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the\\nGuild charges for military transport?\"\\n\"Expensive, eh?\"\\n\"Expensive!\"\\nThe Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. \"If you squeeze Arrakis for every\\ncent it can give us for sixty years, you\\'ll just barely repay us!\"\\nRabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.\\n\"Expensive,\" the Baron sneered. \"The damnable Guild monopoly on space\\nwould\\'ve ruined us if I hadn\\'t planned for this expense long ago. You should\\nknow, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of\\nthe Sardaukar.\"\\nAnd not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a\\nday when the Guild might be circumvented. They were insidious--bleeding off just\\nenough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where\\nthey could force you to pay and pay and pay.\\nAlways, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. \"Hazard rates,\"\\nthe oily Guild agents explained. And for every agent you managed to insert as a\\nwatchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.\\nInsufferable!\\n\"Income then,\" Rabban said.\\nThe Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. \"You must squeeze.\"\\n\"And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?\"\\n\"Anything.\"\\n\"The cannons you brought,\" Rabban said. \"Could I--\"\\n\"I\\'m removing them,\" the Baron said.\\n\"But you--\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"You won\\'t need such toys. They were a special innovation and are now\\nuseless. We need the metal. They cannot go against a shield, Rabban. They were\\nmerely the unexpected. It was predictable that the Duke\\'s men would retreat into\\ncliff caves on this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them in.\"\\n\"The Fremen don\\'t use shields.\"\\n\"You may keep some lasguns if you wish.\"\\n\"Yes, m \\'Lord. And I have a free hand.\"\\n\"As long as you squeeze.\"\\nRabban\\'s smile was gloating. \"I understand perfectly, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"You understand nothing perfectly,\" the Baron growled. \"Let us have that\\nclear at the outset. What you do understand is how to carry out my orders. Has\\nit occurred to you, nephew, that there are at least five million persons on this\\nplanet?\"\\n\"Does m\\'Lord forget that I was his regent-siridar here before? And if m\\'Lord\\nwill forgive me, his estimate may be low. It\\'s difficult to count a population\\nscattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the\\nFremen of--\"\\n\"The Fremen aren\\'t worth considering!\"\\n\"Forgive me, m\\'Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.\"\\nThe Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. \"You know something?\"\\n\"M\\'Lord had retired when I arrived last night. I . . . ah, took the liberty\\nof contacting some of my lieutenants from . . . ah, before. They\\'ve been acting\\nas guides to the Sardaukar. They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar\\nforce somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out.\"\\n\"Wiped out a Sardaukar force?\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Impossible!\"\\nRabban shrugged.\\n\"Fremen defeating Sardaukar,\" the Baron sneered.\\n\"I repeat only what was reported to me,\" Rabban said. \"It is said this\\nFremen force already had captured the Duke\\'s redoubtable Thufir Hawat.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h-h-h-h.\"\\nThe Baron nodded, smiling.\\n\"I believe the report,\" Rabban said. \"You\\'ve no idea what a problem the\\nFremen were.\"\\n\"Perhaps, but these weren\\'t Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must\\'ve been\\nAtreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as Fremen. It\\'s the only possible\\nanswer.\"\\nAgain, Rabban shrugged. \"Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen. The\\nSardaukar already have launched a program to wipe out all Fremen.\"\\n\"Good!\"\\n\"But--\"\\n\"It\\'ll keep the Sardaukar occupied. And we\\'ll soon have Hawat. I know it! I\\ncan feel it! Ah, this has been a day! The Sardaukar off hunting a few useless\\ndesert bands while we get the real prize!\"\\n\"M\\'Lord . . . \" Rabban hesitated, frowning. \"I\\'ve always felt that we\\nunderestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in--\"\\n\"Ignore them, boy! They\\'re rabble. It\\'s the populous towns, cities, and\\nvillages that concern us. A great many people there, eh?\"\\n\"A great many, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"They worry me, Rabban.\"\\n\"Worry you?\"\\n\"Oh . . . ninety per cent of them are of no concern. But there are always a\\nfew . . . Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who might try a dangerous\\nthing. If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what\\nhappened here, I\\'d be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I\\'d be?\"\\nRabban swallowed.\\n\\n\\x0c\"You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor,\"\\nthe Baron said. \"As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was\\nstraightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you\\nunderstand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an\\nunfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though.\\nThat is the story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be\\nlaughed at.\"\\n\"As the Emperor wishes it,\" Rabban said.\\n\"As the Emperor wishes it.\"\\n\"What about the smugglers?\"\\n\"No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At\\nany rate, you\\'ll be spreading some bribes in that quarter . . . and taking other\\nmeasures which I\\'m sure you can think of.\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You\\nmust show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are--slaves envious\\nof their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest\\nvestige of pity or mercy must you show them.\"\\n\"Can one exterminate an entire planet?\" Rabban asked.\\n\"Exterminate?\" Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron\\'s head.\\n\"Who said anything about exterminating?\"\\n\"Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and--\"\\n\"I said squeeze. Nephew, not exterminate. Don\\'t waste the population, merely\\ndrive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy.\" He smiled,\\na baby\\'s expression in the dimple-fat face. \"A carnivore never stops. Show no\\nmercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach\\nrumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry\\nand thirsty.\" The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. \"Like me.\"\\n\"I see, m\\'Lord.\"\\nRabban swung his gaze left and right.\\n\"It\\'s all clear then, Nephew?\"\\n\"Except for one thing. Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes.\"\\n\"Ah, yes, Kynes.\"\\n\"He\\'s the Emperor\\'s man, m\\'Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he\\'s\\nvery close to the Fremen . . . married one.\"\\n\"Kynes will be dead by tomorrow\\'s nightfall.\"\\n\"That\\'s dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant.\"\\n\"How do you think I\\'ve come this far this quickly?\" the Baron demanded. His\\nvoice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. \"Besides, you need never\\nhave feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You\\'re forgetting that he\\'s addicted to\\nthe spice.\"\\n\"Of course!\"\\n\"Those who know will do nothing to endanger their supply,\" the Baron said.\\n\"Kynes certainly must know.\"\\n\"I forgot, \"Rabban said.\\nThey stared at each other in silence.\\nPresently, the Baron said: \"Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of\\nyour first concerns. I\\'ve quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide\\nraid by the Duke\\'s men got most of what we\\'d stored for sale.\"\\nRabban nodded. \"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\nThe Baron brightened. \"Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains\\nof organization here and you\\'ll say to them: \\'Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has\\ncharged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.\\' \"\\n\"I understand, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"This time, I\\'m sure you do. We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow.\\nNow, leave me to finish my sleep.\"\\nThe Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight.\\n\\n\\x0cA tank-brain, the Baron thought. Muscle-minded tank-brain. They will be\\nbloody pulp here when he\\'s through with them. Then, when I send in Feyd-Rautha\\nto take the load off them, they\\'ll cheer their rescuer. Beloved Feyd-Rautha.\\nBenign Feyd-Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from a beast. Feyd-Rautha, a man to follow and die for. The boy will know by that time how to\\noppress with impunity. I\\'m sure he\\'s the one we need. He\\'ll learn. And such a\\nlovely body. Really a lovely boy.\\n', 28: '\\nAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.\\n-from \"A Child\\'s History of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nAs Paul fought the \\'thopter\\'s controls, he grew aware that he was sorting\\nout the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the\\nbasis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of\\nturbulence, an occasional vortex.\\nThe cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of\\ninstrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his\\ninner sense began to see through the curtain.\\nI must find the right vortex, he thought.\\nFor a long time now he had sensed the storm\\'s power diminishing, but still\\nit shook them. He waited out another turbulence.\\nThe vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul\\ndefied all fear to bank the \\'thopter left.\\nJessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.\\n\"Paul!\" she screamed.\\nThe vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the \\'thopter like a\\nchip on a geyser, spewed them up and out--a winged speck within a core of\\nwinding dust lighted by the second moon.\\nPaul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged\\nthem, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert--moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.\\n\"We\\'re out of it,\" Jessica whispered.\\nPaul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he\\nscanned the night sky.\\n\"We\\'ve given them the slip,\" he said.\\nJessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at\\nthe diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that\\ncompounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed\\nthe passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.\\nIt was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The\\nstorm passed through us and around us. It\\'s gone, but we remain.\\n\"I don\\'t like the sound of our wing motion,\" Paul said. \"We suffered some\\ndamage in there.\"\\nHe felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They\\nwere out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient\\nvision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of\\na revelation.\\nHe shivered.\\nThe sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on\\nthe question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was\\nthe spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the\\nlitany, as though the words had a power of their own.\\n\"I shall not fear . . . \"\\n\\n\\x0cCause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself\\npoised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the\\nlitany\\'s magic.\\nWords from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: \"What senses\\ndo we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?\"\\n\"There\\'s rock all around,\" Jessica said.\\nPaul focused on the \\'thopter\\'s launching, shook his head to clear it. He\\nlooked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand\\nahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in\\nthe cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm\\'s doing.\\n\"Better set us down on sand,\" Jessica said. \"The wings might not take full\\nbrake.\"\\nHe nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into\\nmoonlight above the dunes. \"I\\'ll set us down near those rocks. Check your safety\\nharness.\"\\nShe obeyed, thinking: We\\'ve water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we\\ncan survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we\\ncan do.\\n\"Run for those rocks the instant we\\'re stopped,\" Paul said. \"I\\'ll take the\\npack.\"\\n\"Run for . . . \" She fell silent, nodded. \"Worms.\"\\n\"Our friends, the worms,\" he corrected her. \"They\\'ll get this \\'thopter.\\nThere\\'ll be no evidence of where we landed.\"\\nHow direct his thinking, she thought.\\nThey glided lower . . . lower . . .\\nThere came a rushing sense of motion to their passage--blurred shadows of\\ndunes, rocks lifting like islands. The \\'thopter touched a dune top with a soft\\nlurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.\\nHe\\'s killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted\\nherself to admire his competence.\\n\"Brace yourself!\" Paul warned.\\nHe pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder.\\nHe felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind\\nscreamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings\\' leaves.\\nAbruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened\\nby the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the \\'thopter.\\nThe craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the\\nopposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay\\nstopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.\\nPaul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother,\\nwrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry\\nsmell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother\\nwas free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and\\nout onto the \\'thopter\\'s metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its\\nstraps.\\n\"Run!\" he ordered.\\nHe pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower\\nundercut by sandblast winds.\\nJessica leaped off the \\'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune.\\nShe heard Paul\\'s panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that\\ncurved away toward the rocks.\\n\"Follow the ridge,\" Paul ordered. \"It\\'ll be faster.\"\\nThey slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.\\nA new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an\\nabrasive slithering.\\n\"Worm,\" Paul said.\\nIt grew louder.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Faster!\" Paul gasped.\\nThe first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more\\nthan ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.\\nPaul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped\\nhis side as he ran. He took his mother\\'s arm with his other hand. They scrambled\\nonto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\\n\"I can\\'t run any farther,\" Jessica panted.\\nPaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto\\nthe desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel to their rock island--moonlit\\nripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul\\'s eyes at a\\ndistance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once--a\\nshort loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked\\nornithopter.\\nWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\\nThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own\\npath, questing.\\n\"It\\'s bigger than a Guild spaceship,\" Paul whispered. \"I was told worms grew\\nlarge in the deep desert, but I didn\\'t realize . . . how big.\"\\n\"Nor I,\" Jessica breathed.\\nAgain, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving\\ntrack toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage was lost\\nin gentle sand stirrings around them.\\nPaul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and\\nquoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: \"Travel by night and rest in black shade through\\nthe day.\" He looked at his mother. \"We still have a few hours of night. Can you\\ngo on?\"\\n\"In a moment.\"\\nPaul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its\\nstraps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.\\n\"Whenever you\\'re ready,\" he said.\\nShe pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. \"Which\\ndirection?\"\\n\"Where this ridge leads.\" He pointed.\\n\"Deep into the desert,\" she said.\\n\"The Fremen desert,\" Paul whispered.\\nAnd he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient\\nvision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But the set of\\nthe vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared\\ninto his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect\\nregistry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted\\nand approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.\\nIdaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.\\n\"Do you see a way to go?\" Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.\\n\"No,\" he said, \"But we\\'ll go anyway.\"\\nHe settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with\\nbenched ledges climbing away to the south.\\nPaul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.\\nShe noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and\\nparticular--the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were slowed, the\\nwind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go\\nover or go around? The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when\\nnecessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.\\n\"Careful here--this ledge is slippery with sand.\"\\n\"Watch you don\\'t hit your head against this overhang.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Stay below this ridge; the moon\\'s at our backs and it\\'d show our movement\\nto anyone out there.\"\\nPaul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.\\nJessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul\\npulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It tasted\\nbrackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan--a tall fountain enclosing a\\ncurve of sky, such a richness of moisture that it hadn\\'t been noticed for itself\\n. . . only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside\\nit.\\nTo stop, she thought. To rest . . . truly rest.\\nIt occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment.\\nThere was no mercy where there could be no stopping.\\nPaul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping\\nsurface. Jessica followed with a sigh.\\nThey slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face. Again,\\nthey fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.\\nJessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in\\nsubstances beneath their feet and hands--boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock\\nor pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.\\nThe powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea\\ngravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock flakes cut.\\nAnd the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.\\nPaul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled\\ninto him.\\nHe was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood\\natop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred\\nmeters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves--shadows of angles that\\nlapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of\\nanother escarpment.\\n\"Open desert,\" she said.\\n\"A wide place to cross,\" Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter\\ntrap across his face.\\nJessica glanced left and right--nothing but sand below.\\nPaul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of\\nshadows in the moon\\'s passage. \"About three or four kilometers across,\" he said.\\n\"Worms,\" she said.\\n\"Sure to be.\"\\nShe focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. \"Shall\\nwe rest and eat?\"\\nPaul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica\\nsupported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him.\\nShe felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.\\n\"Here,\" he said.\\nHis hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her\\npalm\\nShe swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.\\n\"Drink all your water,\" Paul said. \"Axiom: the best place to conserve your\\nwater is in your body. It keeps your energy up. You\\'re stronger. Trust your\\nstillsuit.\"\\nShe obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought\\nthen how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she\\nrecalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, \"Better a dry\\nmorsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife.\"\\nJessica repeated the words to Paul.\\n\"That was Gurney,\" he said.\\n\\n\\x0cShe caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead,\\nthought: And well poor Gurney might be dead. The Atreides forces were either\\ndead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.\\n\"Gurney always had the right quotation,\" Paul said. \"I can hear him now:\\n\\'And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked;\\nand I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of\\nstrangers.\\' \"\\nJessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in\\nher son\\'s voice.\\nPresently, Paul said: \"How do you . . . feel?\"\\nShe recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: \"Your\\nsister won\\'t be born for many months yet. I still feel . . . physically\\nadequate.\"\\nAnd she thought: How stiffly formal I speak to my own son! Then, because it\\nwas the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she\\nsearched and found the source of her formality: I\\'m afraid of my son; I fear his\\nstrangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.\\nPaul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds\\nof the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He\\nrubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.\\n\"There\\'s melange spice nearby,\" he said.\\nAn eider wind feathered Paul\\'s cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose.\\nBut this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference.\\n\"Dawn soon,\" he said.\\nJessica nodded.\\n\"There\\'s a way to get safely across that open sand,\" Paul said. \"The Fremen\\ndo it.\"\\n\"The worms?\"\\n\"If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,\"\\nPaul said. \"It\\'d keep a worm occupied for a time.\"\\nShe glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other\\nescarpment. \"Four kilometers worth of time?\"\\n\"Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that\\ndon\\'t attract the worms . . . \"\\nPaul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the\\nmysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had\\ncome with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive\\nterror at thought of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his\\nawareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared . . . if . . . if .\\n. .\\nHe shook his head.\\n\"It\\'d have to be sounds without rhythm,\" Jessica said.\\n\"What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps . . . the sand itself must shift down\\nat times. Worms can\\'t investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested\\nbefore we try it, though.\"\\nHe looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the\\nvertical moonshadows there. \"It\\'ll be dawn within the hour.\"\\n\"Where\\'ll we spend the day?\" she asked.\\nPaul turned left, pointed. \"The cliff curves back north over there. You can\\nsee by the way it\\'s wind-cut that\\'s the windward face. There\\'ll be crevasses\\nthere, deep ones.\"\\n\"Had we better get started?\" she asked.\\nHe stood, helped her to her feet. \"Are you rested enough for a climb down? I\\nwant to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp.\"\\n\"Enough.\" She nodded for him to lead the way.\\nHe hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned\\nalong the cliff.\\n\\n\\x0cIf only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. It\\'d be such a simple matter to\\njump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open\\ndesert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.\\nThey came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a\\nfissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.\\nPaul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious\\nthe moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world of deeper\\nand deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The\\nfissure narrowed to some ten meters\\' width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope\\nthat slanted downward into darkness.\\n\"Can we do down?\" Jessica whispered.\\n\"I think so.\"\\nHe tested the surface with one foot.\\n\"We can slide down,\" he said. \"I\\'ll go first. Wait until you hear me stop.\"\\n\"Careful,\" she said.\\nHe stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an\\nalmost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.\\nThere came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the\\nslope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away\\nto silence.\\n\"Mother?\" he said.\\nThere was no answer.\\n\"Mother?\"\\nHe dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging,\\nthrowing sand like a wild man. \"Mother!\" he gasped. \"Mother, where are you?\"\\nAnother cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He\\nwrenched himself out of it.\\nShe\\'s been caught in the sandslide, he thought. Buried in it. I must be calm\\nand work this out carefully. She won\\'t smother immediately. She\\'ll compose\\nherself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows I\\'ll dig for\\nher.\\nIn the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating\\nof his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments\\ncould write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed\\nitself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with\\nthe fractional second of real time required for the total recall.\\nPresently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he\\nfound the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig,\\nmoving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of fabric came\\nunder his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm,\\nexposed her face.\\n\"Do you hear me?\" he whispered.\\nNo answer.\\nHe dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he\\ndetected a slow heartbeat.\\nBindu suspension, he told himself.\\nHe cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders\\nand pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could,\\nfeeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with\\nthe effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of\\nthe fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering\\nrun as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was\\nmagnified within the rock walls.\\nHe stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert\\'s\\nmarching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the sand,\\nuttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.\\nShe awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.\\n\\n\\x0c\"I knew you\\'d find me,\" she whispered.\\nHe looked back up the fissure. \"It might have been kinder if I hadn\\'t.\"\\n\"Paul!\"\\n\"I lost the pack,\" he said. \"It\\'s buried under a hundred tons of sand . . .\\nat least.\"\\n\"Everything?\"\\n\"The spare water, the stilltent--everything that counts.\" He touched a\\npocket. \"I still have the paracompass.\" He fumbled at the waist sash. \"Knife and\\nbinoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we\\'ll die.\"\\nIn that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left\\nbeyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the open\\ndesert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the\\nrocks.\\nBut Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul\\'s face. She edged her\\nvoice with scorn, said: \"Is this the way you were taught?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you understand?\" he asked. \"Everything we need to survive in this\\nplace is under that sand.\"\\n\"You found me,\" she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.\\nPaul squatted back on his heels.\\nPresently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking\\nthe looseness of the sand.\\n\"If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a\\nhole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack. Water\\nmight do it, but we don\\'t have enough water for . . .\" He broke off, then:\\n\"Foam.\"\\nJessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyper-functioning of\\nhis mind.\\nPaul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as\\nhis eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened\\npatch of sand below them.\\n\"Spice,\" he said. \"Its essence--highly alkaline. And I have the paracompass.\\nIts power pack is acid-base.\"\\nJessica sat up straight against the rock.\\nPaul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted\\nsurface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the desert\\'s floor.\\nShe watched the way he walked, breaking his stride--step . . . pause, step-step . . . slide . . . pause . . .\\nThere was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of\\nthe desert moved here.\\nPaul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his\\nrobe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of\\nJessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his\\nknife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts\\non it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism came out next, leaving an\\nempty dished compartment in the instrument.\\n\"You\\'ll need water,\" Jessica said.\\nPaul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it\\ninto the dished compartment.\\nIf this fails, that\\'s water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won\\'t matter\\nthen, anyway.\\nWith his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the\\nwater. They foamed slightly, subsided.\\nJessica\\'s eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of\\nhawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the open\\nwater.\\nGreat Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!\\n\\n\\x0cPaul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button\\nwhich gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in one\\nhand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying\\nthe lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He\\nwaded part way up the slope, kicking off sand rivulets, spurts of dust.\\nPresently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass,\\nshook the instrument case.\\nGreen foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul\\naimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand\\nbeneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.\\nJessica moved to a position below him, called out: \"May I help?\"\\n\"Come up and dig,\" he said. \"We\\'ve about three meters to go. It\\'s going to\\nbe a near thing.\" As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.\\n\"Quickly,\" Paul said. \"No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.\"\\nJessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into\\nthe hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.\\nAs Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the\\nsand down the slope. \"How deep?\" she panted.\\n\"About three meters,\" he said. \"And I can only approximate the position. We\\nmay have to widen this hole.\" He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand.\\n\"Slant your digging backward. Don\\'t go straight down.\"\\nJessica obeyed.\\nSlowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the\\nbasin and still no sign of the pack.\\nCould I have miscalculated? Paul asked himself. I\\'m the one that panicked\\noriginally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?\\nHe looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion\\nremained.\\nJessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her\\ncheek. Her eyes met Paul\\'s.\\n\"The upper face,\" Paul said. \"Gently, now.\" He added another pinch of spice\\nto the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica\\'s hands as she began\\ncutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole. On the second pass, her\\nhands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with\\na plastic buckle.\\n\"Don\\'t move any more of it,\" Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.\\n\"We\\'re out of foam.\"\\nJessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.\\nPaul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said:\\n\"Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I\\'m going to pull you to the\\nside and downhill. Don\\'t let go of that strap. We won\\'t get much more spill from\\nthe top. This slope has stabilized itself. All I\\'m going to aim for is to keep\\nyour head free of the sand. Once that hole\\'s filled, we can dig you out and pull\\nup the pack.\"\\n\"I understand,\" she said.\\n\"Ready?\"\\n\"Ready.\" She tensed her fingers on the strap.\\nWith one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as\\nthe foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had subsided, Jessica\\nremained buried to the waist, her left arm and shoulder still under the sand,\\nher chin protected on a fold of Paul\\'s robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain\\nput on it.\\n\"I still have the strap,\" she said.\\nSlowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap.\\n\"Together,\" he said. \"Steady pressure. We mustn\\'t break it.\"\\n\\n\\x0cMore sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared\\nthe surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand. Together then they\\npulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.\\nIn a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack\\nbetween them.\\nPaul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked\\nto her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a target for\\nballs of wet, green sand.\\n\"You look a mess,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'re not so pretty yourself,\" she said.\\nThey started to laugh, then sobered.\\n\"That shouldn\\'t have happened,\" Paul said. \"I was careless.\"\\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.\\n\"I\\'ll put up the tent,\" he said. \"Better slip off that robe and shake it\\nout.\" He turned away, taking the pack.\\nJessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.\\n\"There\\'s anchor holes in the rock,\" Paul said. \"Someone\\'s tented here\\nbefore.\"\\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place-deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away--far\\nenough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a\\ncrossing.\\nShe turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere\\nblending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his\\nbinoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the\\noil lenses on the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open\\nsand.\\nJessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing\\ninto sand rivers and canyons.\\n\"There are growing things over there,\" he said.\\nJessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up\\nbeside Paul.\\n\"There,\" he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the\\nother.\\nShe looked where he pointed.\\n\"Saguaro,\" she said. \"Scrawny stuff.\"\\n\"There may be people nearby,\" Paul said.\\n\"That could be the remains of a botanical testing station,\" she warned.\\n\"This is pretty far south into the desert,\" he said. He lowered his\\nbinoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his\\nlips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. \"This has the feeling\\nof a Fremen place,\" he said.\\n\"Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?\" she asked.\\n\"Kynes promised their help.\"\\nBut there\\'s desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. I felt\\nsome of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.\\nShe closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a\\nscene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan--she and the\\nDuke Leto, before Paul\\'s birth. They\\'d flown over the southern jungles, above\\nthe weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen\\nthe ant lines in the greenery--man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there\\'d been the white petals of\\ntrimaran dhows.\\nAll of it gone.\\nJessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of\\nthe day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the\\n\\n\\x0copen sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through\\ncheap glass.\\nA spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure.\\nThe sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were\\nbeginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sandfall was gone, she still\\nheard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.\\n\"Worm,\" Paul whispered.\\nIt came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored.\\nA twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of\\nvision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then\\nit was gone, coursing off to the left.\\nThe sound diminished, died.\\n\"I\\'ve seen space frigates that were smaller,\" Paul whispered.\\nShe nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed\\nthere remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them,\\nbeckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.\\n\"When we\\'ve rested,\" Jessica said, \"we should continue with your lessons.\"\\nHe suppressed a sudden anger, said: \"Mother, don\\'t you think we could do\\nwithout . . .\"\\n\"Today you panicked,\" she said. \"You know your mind and bindu-nervature\\nperhaps better than I do, but you\\'ve much yet to learn about your body\\'s prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and I can teach you\\nabout this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body.\\nYou need review of the hands. We\\'ll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and\\ntip sensitivity.\" She turned away. \"Come, into the tent, now.\"\\nHe flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the\\nsphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination .\\n. . that he must agree.\\nWhatever has been done to me, I\\'ve been a party to it, he thought.\\nReview of the hand!\\nHe looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such\\ncreatures as that worm.\\n', 29: '\\nWe came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of fife. There existed no\\nneed on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind--we could\\nsee the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have\\nalways paid for achieving a paradise in this life--we went soft, we lost our\\nedge.\\n-from \"Muad\\'Dib: Conversations\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"So you\\'re the great Gurney Halleck,\" the man said.\\nHalleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated\\nbehind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes\\nthat told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space\\nfrigate\\'s master control center--communications and viewscreens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk\\nformed as a wall projection--part of the remaining curve.\\n\"I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek,\" the smuggler said.\\n\"Then you\\'re the one I owe thanks for the help we\\'ve received,\" Halleck\\nsaid.\\n\"Ah-h-h, gratitude,\" the smuggler said. \"Sit down.\"\\nA ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck\\nsank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection\\nnow in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in\\nhis lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.\\n\\n\\x0cHalleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family\\nresemblance in the smuggler now--the father\\'s heavy, over-hanging eyebrows and\\nrock planes of cheeks and nose.\\n\"Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens,\" Halleck\\nsaid.\\n\"By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people,\" Tuek said.\\nAnger overcame part of Halleck\\'s fatigue. He straightened, said: \"Can you\\nname the traitor?\"\\n\"We are not sure.\"\\n\"Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch . . . perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen\\ncaptive.\"\\n\"I heard,\" Halleck took a deep breath. \"It appears we\\'ve a deal more killing\\nahead of us.\"\\n\"We will do nothing to attract attention to us,\" Tuek said.\\nHalleck stiffened. \"But--\"\\n\"You and those of your men we\\'ve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,\"\\nTuek said. \"You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can\\nalways use good men. We\\'ll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the\\nslightest open move against the Harkonnens.\"\\n\"But they killed your father, man!\"\\n\"Perhaps. And if so, I\\'ll give you my father\\'s answer to those who act\\nwithout thinking: \\'A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool\\'s wrath\\nis heavier than them both.\\' \"\\n\"You mean to do nothing about it, then?\" Halleck sneered.\\n\"You did not hear me say that. I merely say I will protect our contract with\\nthe Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other\\nways of destroying a foe.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h-h-h.\"\\n\"Ah, indeed. If you\\'ve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But I warn\\nyou that you\\'re probably too late . . .and we doubt she\\'s the one you want, any\\nway.\"\\n\"Hawat made few mistakes.\"\\n\"He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.\"\\n\"You think he\\'s the traitor?\"\\nTuek shrugged. \"This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the\\nHarkonnens believe it.\"\\n\"You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.\"\\n\"Hints and suggestions . . . rumors and hunches.\"\\n\"We are seventy-four men,\" Halleck said. \"If you seriously wish us to enlist\\nwith you, you must believe our Duke is dead.\"\\n\"His body has been seen.\"\\n\"And the boy, too--young Master Paul?\" Halleck tried to swallow, found a\\nlump in his throat.\\n\"According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert\\nstorm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found.\"\\n\"So the witch is dead then . . . all dead.\"\\nTuek nodded. \"And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat\\nof power here on Dune.\"\\n\"The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nIt took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to\\novercome him. He spoke with panting breath: \"I\\'ve a score of my own against\\nRabban. I owe him for the lives of my family . . . \" He rubbed at the scar along\\nhis jaw. \" . . . and for this . . . \"\\n\\n\\x0c\"One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely,\" Tuek said. He\\nfrowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck\\'s jaw, the sudden withdrawal\\nin the man\\'s shed-lidded eyes.\\n\"I know . . . I know.\" Halleck took a deep breath.\\n\"You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us.\\nThere are many places to--\"\\n\"I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With\\nRabban here--I stay.\"\\n\"In your mood, I\\'m not sure we want you to stay.\"\\nHalleck stared at the smuggler. \"You doubt my word?\"\\n\"No-o-o . . . \"\\n\"You\\'ve saved me from the Harkonnens. I gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no\\ngreater reason. I\\'ll stay on Arrakis--with you . . . or with the Fremen.\"\\n\"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power,\"\\nTuek said. \"You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to\\nbe too sharp and quick.\"\\nHalleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him.\\n\"Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?\" he\\nmurmured.\\n\"Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,\" Tuek said. \"Speed is a\\ndevice of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow--we\\'ve the diversions for it; three things\\nthere are that ease the heart--water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.\"\\nHalleck opened his eyes. \"I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen\\nflowing about my feet.\" He stared at Tuek. \"You think that day will come?\"\\n\"I have little to do with how you\\'ll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. I can\\nonly help you meet today.\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge\\nyour father and all the others who--\"\\n\"Listen to me, fighting man,\" Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk,\\nhis shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler\\'s face was suddenly\\nlike weathered stone. \"My father\\'s water--I\\'ll buy that back myself, with my own\\nblade.\"\\nHalleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the smuggler reminded him of\\nDuke Leto: a leader of men, courageous, secure in his own position and his own\\ncourse. He was like the Duke . . . before Arrakis.\\n\"Do you wish my blade beside you?\" Halleck asked.\\nTuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.\\n\"Do you think of me as fighting man? \" Halleck pressed.\\n\"You\\'re the only one of the Duke\\'s lieutenants to escape,\" Tuek said. \"Your\\nenemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him . . . You defeated him the way\\nwe defeat Arrakis.\"\\n\"Eh?\"\\n\"We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,\" Tuek said. \"Arrakis is\\nour enemy.\"\\n\"One enemy at a time, is that it?\"\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\n\"Is that the way the Fremen make out?\"\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\"You said I might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the\\ndesert, in the open, is that why?\"\\n\"Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man\\'s\\nland. But I wish to talk more about--\"\\n\"I\\'m told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,\"\\nHalleck said. \"But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and\\nthere if you know where to look.\"\\n\"Rumors!\" Tuek sneered. \"Do you wish to choose now between me and the\\nFremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock,\\n\\n\\x0cour own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few\\nragged bands that we use as spice-hunters.\"\\n\"But they can kill Harkonnens.\"\\n\"And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down\\nlike animals--with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being\\nexterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens.\"\\n\"Was it Harkonnens they killed?\" Halleck asked.\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"Haven\\'t you heard that there may\\'ve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?\"\\n\"More rumors.\"\\n\"But a pogrom--that isn\\'t like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful.\"\\n\"I believe what I see with my own eyes,\" Tuek said. \"Make your choice,\\nfighting man. Me or the Fremen. I will promise you sanctuary and a chance to\\ndraw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the\\nlife of the hunted.\"\\nHalleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek\\'s words, yet troubled\\nfor no reason he could explain.\\n\"Trust your own abilities,\" Tuek said. \"Whose decisions brought your force\\nthrough the battle? Yours. Decide.\"\\n\"It must be,\" Halleck said. \"The Duke and his son are dead?\"\\n\"The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, I incline to\\ntrust the Harkonnens.\" A grim smile touched Tuek\\'s mouth. \"But it\\'s about the\\nonly trust I give them.\"\\n\"Then it must be,\" Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and\\nthumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. \"I give you my sword.\"\\n\"Accepted.\"\\n\"Do you wish me to persuade my men?\"\\n\"You\\'d let them make their own decision?\"\\n\"They\\'ve followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn\\'t what\\nthey thought it\\'d be. Here, they\\'ve lost everything except their lives. I\\'d\\nprefer they decided for themselves now.\"\\n\"Now is no time for you to falter,\" Tuek said. \"They\\'ve followed you this\\nfar.\"\\n\"You need them, is that it?\"\\n\"We can always use experienced fighting men . . . in these times more than\\never.\"\\n\"You\\'ve accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?\"\\n\"I think they\\'ll follow you, Gurney Halleck.\"\\n\" \\'Tis to be hoped.\"\\n\"Indeed.\"\\n\"I may make my own decision in this, then?\"\\n\"Your own decision.\"\\nHalleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his\\nreserve strength even that small effort required. \"For now, I\\'ll see to their\\nquarters and well-being,\" he said.\\n\"Consult my quartermaster,\" Tuek said. \"Drisq is his name. Tell him it\\'s my\\nwish that you receive every courtesy. I\\'ll join you myself presently. I\\'ve some\\noff-shipments of spice to see to first.\"\\n\"Fortune passes everywhere,\" Halleck said.\\n\"Everywhere,\" Tuek said. \"A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our\\nbusiness.\"\\nHalleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a\\nlockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the\\noffice.\\nHe found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been\\nled by Tuek\\'s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native\\nrock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The\\n\\n\\x0cceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of\\nthe rock and to permit internal air-convection currents. Weapons racks and\\nlockers lined the walls.\\nHalleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to\\nstand were standing--no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler\\nmedics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled\\nin one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.\\nThe Atreides training--\"We care for our own!\"--it held like a core of native\\nrock in them, Halleck noted.\\nOne of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck\\'s nine-string\\nbaliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, said: \"Sir, the medics here\\nsay there\\'s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here--only\\noutpost medicine. Mattai can\\'t last, they say, and he has a request of you.\"\\n\"What is it?\"\\nThe lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. \"Mattai wants a song to ease his\\ngoing, sir. He says you\\'ll know the one . . . he\\'s asked it of you often\\nenough.\" The lieutenant swallowed. \"It\\'s the one called \\'My Woman,\\' sir. If you-\"\\n\"I know.\" Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch\\non the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone\\nhad already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of\\nhis thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to\\nsmile casually.\\nSeveral of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters.\\nOne of the men began singing softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:\\n\"My woman stands at her window,\\nCurved lines \\'gainst square glass.\\nUprais\\'d arms . . . bent . . . downfolded.\\n\\'Gainst sunset red and golded-Come to me . . .\\nCome to me, warm arms of my lass.\\nFor me . . .\\nFor me, the warm arms of my lass.\"\\nThe singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the\\nman on the litter.\\nHalleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are\\nseventy-three.\\n', 30: '\\nFamily life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but\\nI shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real\\nfriend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of\\nthe deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man,\\nbrought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my\\nmother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of\\nself-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene\\nGesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the\\nintrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my\\nmother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a\\ndreadful thing to say, but I \\'m not at all sure my father was innocent in all\\nthese attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a\\ndancer\\'s muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My\\n\\n\\x0cfather looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him.\\nFinally he said: \"She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift. \" You have\\nno idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche.\\nSubtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.\\n-\"In My Father\\'s House\" by the Princess Irulan\\nPaul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where\\nhe had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He stared out across the open sand\\nat the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in\\nthe tent.\\nFolds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their shelter. Away from the setting\\nsun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night.\\nAnd the flatness.\\nHis mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no\\npersuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that horizon--no bloom or gently\\nshaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze . . . only dunes and that distant\\ncliff beneath a sky of burnished silver-blue.\\nWhat if there isn\\'t one of the abandoned testing stations across there? he\\nwondered. What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an\\naccident?\\nWithin the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong\\nout the transparent end at Paul, He stood with his back to her and something\\nabout his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising\\nwithin her and turned away.\\nPresently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the\\ntent\\'s catchpocket, and slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her\\nmuscles.\\nPaul spoke without turning: \"I find myself enjoying the quiet here.\"\\nHow the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she recalled\\na Bene Gesserit axiom: \"The mind can go either direction under stress--toward\\npositive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes\\nare unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive\\nend. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by\\ntraining.\"\\n\"It could be a good life here,\" Paul said.\\nShe tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the\\nrigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering at the possible futures\\nPaul had glimpsed. One could be alone out here, she thought, without fear of\\nsomeone behind you, without fear of the hunter.\\nShe stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and\\nstudied the escarpment across from them. Yes, saguaro in the arroyos and other\\nspiny growth . . . and a matting of low grasses, yellow-green in the shadows.\\n\"I\\'ll strike camp,\" Paul said.\\nJessica nodded, walked to the fissure\\'s mouth where she could get a sweep of\\nthe desert, and swung her binoculars to the left. A salt pan glared white there\\nwith a blending of dirty tan at its edges--a field of white out here where white\\nwas death. But the pan said another thing: water. At some time water had flowed\\nacross that glaring white. She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose,\\nlistened for a moment to the sound of Paul\\'s movements.\\nThe sun dipped lower. Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild\\ncolor spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed into a toe of darkness\\ntesting the sand. Coal-colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night\\nblotted the desert.\\nStars!\\nShe stared up at them, sensing Paul\\'s movements as he came up beside her.\\nThe desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars. The\\nweight of the day receded. There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.\\n\\n\\x0c\"The first moon will be up soon,\" Paul said. \"The pack\\'s ready. I\\'ve\\nplanted the thumper.\"\\nWe could be lost forever in this hellplace, she thought. And no one to know.\\nThe night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the\\nsmell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark.\\n\"Smell that,\" Paul said.\\n\"I can smell it even through the filter,\" she said. \"Riches. But will it buy\\nwater?\" She pointed across the basin. \"There are no artificial lights across\\nthere.\"\\n\"Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks,\" he said.\\nA sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon. It\\nlifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its face. Jessica studied the white-silver of sand exposed in the light.\\n\"I planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse,\" Paul said.\\n\"Whenever I light its candle it\\'ll give us about thirty minutes.\"\\n\"Thirty minutes?\"\\n\"Before it starts calling . . . a . . . worm.\"\\n\"Oh. I\\'m ready to go.\"\\nHe slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their\\nfissure.\\nThe night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow . . . if we \\'re to\\nhave a tomorrow. She shook her head. Why must I be so morbid? I was trained\\nbetter than that!\\nPaul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first spreading\\ndune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him. He heard\\nher soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sound--the desert\\'s own\\ncode spelling out its measure of safety.\\n\"We must walk without rhythm,\" Paul said and he called up memory of men\\nwalking the sand . . . both prescient memory and real memory.\\n\"Watch how I do it,\" he said. \"This is how Fremen walk the sand.\"\\nHe stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of\\nit, moved with a dragging pace.\\nJessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She saw\\nthe sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of sand . . . like\\nthe wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step . . . drag\\n. . . drag . . . step . . . step . . . wait . . . drag . . . step . . .\\nTime stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no\\nnearer. The one behind still lowered high.\\n\"Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!\"\\nIt was a drumming from the cliff behind.\\n\"The thumper,\" Paul hissed.\\nIts pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it\\nin their stride.\\n\"Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . .\"\\nThey moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping. Down and\\nup through spilling dunes: step . . .drag . . . wait . . . step . . . Across pea\\nsand that rolled under their feet: drag . . . wait . . . step . . .\\nAnd all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.\\nThe sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage\\nmasked it. But it grew . . . louder and louder . . . out of the west.\\n\"Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . \" drummed the thumper.\\nThe hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned their\\nheads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.\\n\"Keep moving,\" Paul whispered. \"Don\\'t look back.\"\\nA grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left. It was\\na flailing avalanche of noise.\\n\"Keep moving,\" Paul repeating.\\n\\n\\x0cHe saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces--the\\none ahead and the one behind--appeared equally remote.\\nAnd still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated\\nthe night.\\nThey moved on and on and on . . . Muscles reached a stage of mechanical\\naching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the beckoning,\\nescarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.\\nJessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her\\nwill alone kept her walking. Dryness ached in her mouth, but the sounds behind\\ndrove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuit\\'s catchpockets.\\n\"Lump . . . lump . . . \"\\nRenewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper.\\nSilence!\\n\"Faster,\" Paul whispered.\\nShe nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to\\ntell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already\\nwere being taxed to their limits--the unnatural movement . . .\\nThe rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a\\nplane of flat sand stretching out at the base. He stepped onto it, stumbled in\\nhis fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary out-thrusting of a foot.\\nResonant booming shook the sand around them.\\nPaul lurched sideways two steps.\\n\"Boom! Boom!\"\\n\"Drum sand!\" Jessica hissed.\\nPaul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around them,\\nthe rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.\\nBehind them, he heard a hissing--like the wind, like a riptide where there\\nwas no water.\\n\"Run!\" Jessica screamed. \"Paul, run!\"\\nThey ran.\\nDrum sound boomed beneath their feet. Then they were out of it and into pea\\ngravel. For a time, the running was a relief to muscles that ached from\\nunfamiliar, rhythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here was\\nrhythm. But sand and gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of\\nthe worm was storm sound that grew around them.\\nJessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and\\nthe sound and the terror.\\nPaul dragged her up.\\nThey ran on, hand in hand.\\nA thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another.\\nJessica\\'s mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.\\nThere was another--wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.\\nAnother.\\nRock!\\nShe felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new\\nstrength from the firmer footing.\\nA deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead of\\nthem. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole.\\nBehind them, the sound of the worm\\'s passage stopped.\\nJessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.\\nWhere the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock\\nbeach, a silver-gray curve broached from the desert, sending rivers of sand and\\ndust cascading all around. It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing\\nmouth. It was a round, black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.\\nThe mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled.\\nCinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.\\nBack and forth the great mouth wove.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul stilled his breathing.\\nJessica crouched staring.\\nIt took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the\\nprimal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that threatened to fill her mind.\\nPaul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a time\\nbarrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing\\nrevealed to his inner eye. It was as though some step he had taken had plunged\\nhim into a well . . . or into the trough of a wave where the future was\\ninvisible. The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.\\nInstead of frightening him, the sensation of time-darkness forced a hyper-acceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering every available\\naspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was\\nsome eighty meters in diameter . . . crystal teeth with the curved shape of\\ncrysknives glinting around the rim . . . the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle\\naldehydes . . . acids . . .\\nThe worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A\\nshower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.\\nPaul crowded his mother farther back.\\nCinnamon!\\nThe smell of it flooded across him.\\nWhat has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he\\nremembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between\\nworm and spice.\\n\"Barrrroooom!\"\\nIt was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.\\nAgain: \"Barrrroooom!\"\\nThe worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth\\nweaving moonflashes.\\n\"Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!\"\\nAnother thumper! Paul thought.\\nAgain it sounded off to their right.\\nA shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand. Only\\na mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of a tunnel\\nrearing above the dunes.\\nSand rasped.\\nThe creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of\\ncresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes.\\nPaul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste\\ntoward the new thumper summons.\\nJessica followed, listening: \"Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . .\\nlump . . .\"\\nPresently the sound stopped.\\nPaul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.\\nJessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the\\naftermath of terror. \"Has it gone for sure?\" she whispered.\\n\"Somebody called it,\" Paul said. \"Fremen.\"\\nShe felt herself recovering. \"It was so big!\"\\n\"Not as big as the one that got our \\'thopter.\"\\n\"Are you sure it was Fremen?\"\\n\"They used a thumper.\"\\n\"Why would they help us?\"\\n\"Maybe they weren\\'t helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\nAn answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come. He\\nhad a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks\\nin their packs--the \"maker hooks.\"\\n\"Why would they call a worm?\" Jessica asked.\\n\\n\\x0cA breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from\\nhis mother, to look up the cliff. \"We\\'d better find a way up there before\\ndaylight.\" He pointed. \"Those poles we passed--there are more of them.\"\\nShe looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles--wind-scratched\\nmarkers--made out the shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high\\nabove them.\\n\"They mark a way up the cliff,\" Paul said. He settled his shoulders into the\\npack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward.\\nJessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.\\nUp they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a\\nnarrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.\\nPaul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the\\nprecarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to slow\\ncaution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched away upward,\\nopen to the stars at the top. His ears searched, found only sounds he could\\nexpect--a tiny spill of sand, an insect brrr, the patter of a small running\\ncreature. He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock\\nbeneath a gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for\\nhis mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her around.\\nThey looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his mother\\nbeside him as a cloudy gray movement. \"If we could only risk a light,\" he\\nwhispered.\\n\"We have other senses than eyes,\" she said.\\nPaul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other\\nfoot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled himself up\\nonto it. He reached back, felt his mother\\'s arm, tugged at her robe for her to\\nfollow.\\nAnother step.\\n\"It goes on up to the top, I think,\" he whispered.\\nShallow and even steps, Jessica thought. Man-carved beyond a doubt.\\nShe followed the shadowy movement of Paul\\'s progress, feeling out the steps.\\nRock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them. The steps ended in\\na slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto\\na shallow, moonlit basin.\\nPaul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: \"What a beautiful\\nplace.\"\\nJessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind\\nhim.\\nIn spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the\\nconfinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest,\\nthis basin\\'s beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.\\n\"Like a fairyland,\" Paul whispered.\\nJessica nodded.\\nSpreading away in front of her stretched desert growth--bushes, cacti, tiny\\nclumps of leaves--all trembling in the moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her\\nleft, moonfrosted on her right.\\n\"This must be a Fremen place,\" Paul said.\\n\"There would have to be people for this many plants to survive,\" she agreed.\\nShe uncapped the tube to her stillsuit\\'s catchpockets, sipped at it. Warm,\\nfaintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how it refreshed her.\\nThe tube\\'s cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it.\\nMovement caught Paul\\'s attention--to his right and down on the basin floor\\ncurving out beneath them. He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a\\nwedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump, pop-hop of\\ntiny motion.\\n\"Mice!\" he hissed.\\nPop-hop-hop! they went, into shadows and out.\\n\\n\\x0cSomething fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice. There came a thin\\nscreech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the\\nbasin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.\\nWe needed that reminder, Jessica thought.\\nPaul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly\\ncutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night. The predatory bird--he\\nthought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a stillness to the basin\\nso unuttered that the blue-milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across\\nsentinel saguaro and spiked paintbrush. There was a low humming of light here\\nmore basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.\\n\"We\\'d better find a place to pitch the tent,\" he said. \"Tomorrow we can try\\nto find the Fremen who--\"\\n\"Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!\"\\nIt was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the\\nmoment. The voice came from above them and to their right.\\n\"Please do not run, intruders,\" the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into\\nthe defile. \"If you run you\\'ll only waste your body\\'s water.\"\\nThey want us for the water of our flesh! Jessica thought. Her muscles\\noverrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal.\\nShe pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: Such stealth! I didn\\'t hear\\nhim. And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only\\nthe small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.\\nAnother voice called from the basin\\'s rim to their left. \"Make it quick,\\nStil. Get their water and let\\'s be on our way. We\\'ve little enough time before\\ndawn.\"\\nPaul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin\\nthat he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities\\nby a momentary panic. He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, than\\nfall into the semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of\\nmuscles that can slash in any direction.\\nStill, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was\\nblind time, no future he had seen . . . and they were caught between wild Fremen\\nwhose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.\\n', 31: '\\nThis Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize\\nas \"The Pillars of the Universe,\" whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with\\nsigns and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose\\nprofound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but\\nstamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by \"The\\nOld Man\\'s Hymn\"?\\nI drove my feet through a desert\\nWhose mirage fluttered like a host.\\nVoracious for glory, greedy for danger,\\nI roamed the horizons of al-Kulab,\\nWatching time level mountains\\nIn its search and its hunger for me.\\nAnd I saw the sparrows swiftly approach,\\nBolder than the onrushing wolf.\\nThey spread in the tree of my youth.\\nI heard the flock in my branches\\nAnd was caught on their beaks and claws!\\n-from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe man crawled across a dunetop. He was a mote caught in the glare of the\\nnoon sun. He was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak, his skin bare\\n\\n\\x0cto the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but\\nthe man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair\\nprotruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows. Beneath the blue-within-blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks. A matted\\ndepression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked\\nout its path from nose to catchpockets.\\nThe man stopped half across the dunecrest, arms stretched down the slipface.\\nBlood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs. Patches of yellow-gray\\nsand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself\\nto his feet, stood there swaying. And even in this almost-random action there\\nremained a trace of once-precise movement.\\n\"I am Liet-Kynes,\" he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his\\nvoice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known. \"I am His Imperial\\nMajesty\\'s Planetologist,\" he whispered, \"planetary ecologist for Arrakis. I am\\nsteward of this land.\"\\nHe stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face.\\nHis hands dug feebly into the sand.\\nI am steward of this sand, he thought.\\nHe realized that he was semi-delirious, that he should dig himself into the\\nsand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it. But he\\ncould still smell the rank, semisweet esters of a pre-spice pocket somewhere\\nunderneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any\\nother Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep\\nunder the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.\\nHis hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.\\nA thought spread across his mind--clear, distinct: The real wealth of a\\nplanet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of\\ncivilization--agriculture.\\nAnd he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single\\ntrack, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here\\nwithout water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didn\\'t.\\nThey had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the\\nimpersonal hands of his planet.\\nThe Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought. We\\ndon\\'t die easily. I should be dead now . . . I will be dead soon . . . but I\\ncan\\'t stop being an ecologist.\\n\"The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences.\"\\nThe voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was\\ndead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before him-his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.\\n\"Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son,\" his father said. \"You should\\'ve\\nknown the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke.\"\\nI\\'m delirious, Kynes thought.\\nThe voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through\\nsand, turning to look in that direction--nothing except a curving stretch of\\ndune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.\\n\"The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for\\nlife,\" his father said. And the voice came now from his left, from behind him.\\nWhy does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn\\'t he want me to\\nsee him?\\n\"Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life,\" his father\\nsaid. \"Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It binds more energy\\ninto the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to\\norganism.\"\\nWhy does he keep harping on the same subject? Kynes asked himself. I knew\\nthat before I was ten.\\n\\n\\x0cDesert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began\\nto circle over him. Kynes saw a shadow pass near his hand, forced his head\\nfarther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch on silver-blue\\nsky--distant flecks of soot floating above him.\\n\"We are generalists,\" his father said. \"You can\\'t draw neat lines around\\nplanet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit science.\"\\nWhat\\'s he trying to tell me? Kynes wondered. Is there some consequence I\\nfailed to see?\\nHis cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock\\nodor beneath the pre-spice gasses. From some corner of logic in his mind, a\\nthought formed: Those are carrion-eater birds over me. Perhaps some of my Fremen\\nwill see them and come to investigate.\\n\"To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings,\" his\\nfather said. \"You must cultivate ecological, literacy among the people. That\\'s\\nwhy I\\'ve created this entirely new form of ecological notation.\"\\nHe\\'s repeating things he said to me when I was a child, Kynes thought.\\nHe began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: The\\nsun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you\\'re hot; the sun is burning the\\nmoisture out of your body.\\nHis fingers clawed feebly at the sand.\\nThey couldn\\'t even leave me a stillsuit!\\n\"The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation\\nfrom living bodies,\" his father said.\\nWhy does he keep repeating the obvious? Kynes wondered.\\nHe tried to think of moisture in the air--grass covering this dune . . .\\nopen water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water open to the\\nsky except in text illustrations. Open water . . . irrigation water . . . it\\ntook five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per\\ngrowing season, he remembered.\\n\"Our first goal on Arrakis,\" his father said, \"is grassland provinces. We\\nwill start with these mutated poverty grasses. When we have moisture locked in\\ngrasslands, we\\'ll move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of\\nwater--small at first--and situated along lines of prevailing winds with\\nwindtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind\\nsteals. We must create a true sirocco--a moist wind--but we will never get away\\nfrom the necessity for windtraps.\"\\nAlways lecturing me, Kynes thought. Why doesn\\'t he shut up? Can\\'t he see I\\'m\\ndying?\\n\"You will die, too,\" his father said, \"if you don\\'t get off the bubble\\nthat\\'s forming right now deep underneath you. It\\'s there and you know it. You\\ncan smell the pre-spice gasses. You know the little makers are beginning to lose\\nsome of their water into the mass.\"\\nThe thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it now-sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half-plant, half-animal\\nlittle makers--and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest,\\npure, liquid, soothing water into . . .\\nA pre-spice mass!\\nHe inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him\\nthan it had been.\\nKynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried\\nflapping of wings.\\nThis is spice desert, he thought. There must be Fremen about even in the day\\nsun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.\\n\"Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life,\" his father\\nsaid. \"Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement adjust to\\nphysical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement now,\\nalign it for our purposes.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Shut up, old man,\" Kynes muttered.\\n\"We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet,\"\\nhis father said. \"We must use man as a constructive ecological force--inserting\\nadapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place--to\\ntransform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.\"\\n\"Shut up!\" Kynes croaked.\\n\"It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship\\nbetween worms and spice,\" his father said.\\nA worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope. A maker\\'s sure to come when this\\nbubble bursts. But I have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker without hooks?\\nHe could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him.\\nWater so near--only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but\\nno way to trap it on the surface and use it.\\nKynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his\\nmovements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the\\nsensation was remote.\\n\"The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of\\nnative life forms,\" his father said. \"How strange that so few people ever looked\\nup from the spice long enough to wonder at the near-ideal nitrogen-oxygen-CO2\\nbalance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The\\nenergy sphere of the planet is there to see and understand--a relentless\\nprocess, but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something\\noccupies that gap. Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious\\nafter they are explained. I knew the little maker was there, deep in the sand,\\nlong before I ever saw it.\"\\n\"Please stop lecturing me, Father,\" Kynes whispered.\\nA hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold its\\nwings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned the energy to croak at it. The\\nbird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.\\n\"Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets\\nbefore now,\" his father said. \"Nature tends to compensate for diseases, to\\nremove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way.\"\\nThe hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It\\ntransferred its attention to his outstretched hand.\\nKynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.\\n\"The historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on\\nArrakis,\" his father said. \"You cannot go on forever stealing what you need\\nwithout regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a planet are\\nwritten into its economic and political record. We have the record in front of\\nus and our course is obvious.\"\\nHe never could stop lecturing, Kynes thought. Lecturing, lecturing,\\nlecturing--always lecturing.\\nThe hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes\\' outstretched hand, turned its head\\nfirst one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.\\n\"Arrakis is a one-crop planet,\" his father said. \"One crop. It supports a\\nruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath\\nthem, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It\\'s the masses and\\nthe leavings that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has\\never been suspected.\"\\n\"I\\'m ignoring you, Father,\" Kynes whispered. \"Go away.\"\\nAnd he thought: Surely there must be some of my Fremen near. They cannot\\nhelp but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to see if there\\'s\\nmoisture available.\\n\"The masses of Arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with\\nwater,\" his father said. \"Most of them, of course, will have only a semimystical\\nunderstanding of how we intend to do this. Many, not understanding the\\nprohibitive mass-ratio problem, may even think we\\'ll bring water from some other\\n\\n\\x0cplanet rich in it. Let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in\\nus.\"\\nIn a minute I\\'ll get up and tell him what I think of him, Kynes thought.\\nStanding there lecturing me when he should be helping me.\\nThe bird took another hop closer to Kynes\\' outstretched hand. Two more hawks\\ndrifted down to the sand behind it.\\n\"Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,\" his father\\nsaid. \"An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties.\\nThis will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater\\nbravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as\\nupon the bravery of a whole population.\"\\nWhere is my population now when I need it most? Kynes thought. He summoned\\nall his strength, moved his hand a finger\\'s width toward the nearest hawk. It\\nhopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.\\n\"Our timetable, will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,\" his\\nfather said. \"A planet\\'s life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric. Vegetation\\nand animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we\\nmanipulate. As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become\\ncontrolling influences in their own right--and we will have to deal with them,\\ntoo. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the\\nenergy surface--only three per cent--to tip the entire structure over into our\\nself-sustaining system.\"\\nWhy aren\\'t you helping we? Kynes wondered. Always the same: when I need you\\nmost, you fail me. He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his\\nfather\\'s voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer his demand.\\nKynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time\\nwhile its companions waited in mock indifference. The hawk stopped only a hop\\naway from his hand.\\nA profound clarity filled Kynes\\' mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential for\\nArrakis that his father had never seen. The possibilities along that different\\npath flooded through him.\\n\"No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall\\ninto the hands of a Hero,\" his father said.\\nReading my mind! Kynes thought. Well . . . let him.\\nThe messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thought.\\nNothing can stop them. If the Duke\\'s son is alive they\\'ll find him and protect\\nhim as I have commanded. They may discard the woman, his mother, but they\\'ll\\nsave the boy.\\nThe hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his hand.\\nIt tipped its head to examine the supine flesh. Abruptly, it straightened,\\nstretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and\\nbanked away overhead with its companions behind it.\\nThey\\'ve come! Kynes thought. My Fremen have found me!\\nThen he heard the sand rumbling.\\nEvery Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the\\nnoises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass\\nhad accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had\\nreached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide\\nwas forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous \"blow\" with a dust\\nwhirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand\\nfor whatever lay on the surface.\\nThe hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. They knew what was\\nhappening. Any desert creature would know.\\nAnd I am a desert creature, Kynes thought. You see me, Father? I am a desert\\ncreature.\\nHe felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf\\nhim, dragging him down into cool darkness. For a moment, the sensation of\\n\\n\\x0ccoolness and the moisture were blessed relief. Then, as his planet killed him,\\nit occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong,\\nthat the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.\\nEven the hawks could appreciate these facts.\\n', 32: '\\nProphecy and prescience--How can they be put to the test in the face of the\\nunanswered questions? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the \"waveform\"\\n(as Muad\\'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping\\nthe future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of\\nprophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a\\nfault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?\\n-\"Private Reflections on Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"Get their water,\" the man calling out of the night had said. And Paul\\nfought down his fear, glanced at his mother. His trained eyes saw her readiness\\nfor battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.\\n\"It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand,\" the\\nvoice above them said.\\nThat\\'s the one who spoke to us first, Jessica thought. There are at least\\ntwo of them--one to our right and one on our left.\\n\"Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas\\nlele pal hrobas!\"\\nIt was the man to their right calling out across the basin.\\nTo Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training,\\nJessica recognized the speech. It was Chakobsa, one of the ancient hunting\\nlanguages, and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the\\nstrangers they sought.\\nIn the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoop-wheel face\\nof the second moon--faintly ivory blue--rolled over the rocks across the basin,\\nbright and peering.\\nScrambling sounds came from the rocks--above and to both sides . . . dark\\nmotions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through the shadows.\\nA whole troop! Paul thought with a sudden pang.\\nA tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth\\nbaffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the\\nsidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his\\nhood.\\n\"What have we here--jinn or human?\" he asked.\\nAnd Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, she allowed herself a faint\\nhope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with\\nits intrusion from the night.\\n\"Human, I warrant,\" the man said.\\nJessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the man\\'s robe.\\nShe permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no shields.\\n\"Do you also speak?\" the man asked.\\nJessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and\\nvoice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain\\nshe had a register on his culture and weaknesses.\\n\"Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?\" she demanded.\\nThe burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow\\nrelaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.\\nPaul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each\\nof them a clearer arena of action.\\n\\n\\x0cThe hooded head turned at Paul\\'s movement, opening a wedge of face to\\nmoonlight. Jessica saw a sharp nose, one glinting eye--dark, so dark the eye,\\nwithout any white in it--a heavy brown and upturned mustache.\\n\"A likely cub,\" the man said. \"If you\\'re fugitives from the Harkonnens, it\\nmay be you\\'re welcome among us. What is it, boy?\"\\nThe possibilities flashed through Paul\\'s mind: A trick? A fact? Immediate\\ndecision was needed.\\n\"Why should you welcome fugitives?\" he demanded.\\n\"A child who thinks and speaks like a man,\" the tall man said. \"Well, now,\\nto answer your question, my young wali, I am one who does not pay the fai, the\\nwater tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I might welcome a fugitive.\"\\nHe knows who we are, Paul thought. There\\'s concealment in his voice.\\n\"I am Stilgar, the Fremen,\" the tall man said. \"Does that speed your tongue,\\nboy?\"\\nIt is the same voice, Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this\\nman seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.\\n\"I know you, Stilgar,\" Paul said. \"I was with my father in Council when you\\ncame for the water of your friend. You took away with you my father\\'s man,\\nDuncan Idaho--an exchange of friends.\"\\n\"And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,\" Stilgar said.\\nJessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for\\nattack.\\nThe voice from the rocks above them called: \"We waste time here, Stil.\"\\n\"This is the Duke\\'s son,\" Stilgar barked. \"He\\'s certainly the one Liet told\\nus to seek.\"\\n\"But . . . a child, Stil.\"\\n\"The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper,\" Stilgar said. \"That was a\\nbrave crossing he made in the path of shai-hulud. \"\\nAnd Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed\\nsentence?\\n\"We haven\\'t time for the test,\" the voice above them protested.\\n\"Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,\" Stilgar said.\\nHe\\'s looking for an omen! Jessica thought.\\n\"But the woman,\" the voice above them said.\\nJessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice.\\n\"Yes, the woman,\" Stilgar said. \"And her water.\"\\n\"You know the law,\" said the voice from the rocks. \"Ones who cannot live\\nwith the desert--\"\\n\"Be quiet,\" Stilgar said. \"Times change.\"\\n\"Did Liet command this?\" asked the voice from the rocks.\\n\"You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis,\" Stilgar said. \"Why do you press\\nme?\"\\nAnd Jessica thought: Cielago! the clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of\\nunderstanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant bat, a\\nsmall flying mammal. Voice of the cielago: they had received a distrans message\\nto seek Paul and herself.\\n\"I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar,\" said the voice above\\nthem.\\n\"My duty is the strength of the tribe,\" Stilgar said. \"That is my only duty.\\nI need no one to remind me of it. This child-man interests me. He is full-fleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the father sun. He\\nhas not the eyes of the ibad.

How can this be?\"\\n\"We cannot stay out here all night arguing,\" said the voice from the rocks.\\n\"If a patrol--\"\\n\"I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet,\" Stilgar said.\\n\\n\\x0cThe man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing\\nby a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their\\nleft.\\n\"The voice of the cielago suggested there\\'d be value to us in saving you\\ntwo,\" Stilgar said. \"I can see possibility in this strong boy-man: he is young\\nand can learn. But what of yourself, woman?\" He stared at Jessica.\\nI have his voice and pattern registered now, Jessica thought. I could\\ncontrol him with a word, but he\\'s a strong man . . . worth much more to us\\nunblunted and with full freedom of action. We shall see.\\n\"I am the mother of this boy,\" Jessica said. \"In part, his strength which\\nyou admire is the product of my training.\"\\n\"The strength of a woman can be boundless,\" Stilgar said. \"Certain it is in\\na Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?\"\\nFor the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered\\ntruthfully, \"No.\"\\n\"Are you trained in the ways of the desert?\"\\n\"No, but many consider my training valuable.\"\\n\"We make our own judgments on value,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"Every man has the right to his own judgments,\" she said.\\n\"It is well that you see the reason,\" Stilgar said. \"We cannot dally here to\\ntest you, woman. Do you understand? We\\'d not want your shade to plague us. I\\nwill take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my countenance, sanctuary in\\nmy tribe. But for you, woman--you understand there is nothing personal in this?\\nIt is the rule, Istislah, in the general interest. Is that not enough?\"\\nPaul took a half-step forward. \"What are you talking about?\"\\nStilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica.\\n\"Unless you\\'ve been deep-trained from childhood to live here, you could bring\\ndestruction onto an entire tribe. It is the law, and we cannot carry useless . .\\n. \"\\nJessica\\'s motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground. It\\nwas the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do, and the obvious slows an\\nopponent\\'s reactions. It takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that\\nthing is exposed as something unknown. She shifted as she saw his right shoulder\\ndrop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position.\\nA turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was against the\\nrocks with the man helpless in front of her.\\nAt his mother\\'s first movement, Paul backed two steps. As she attacked, he\\ndove for shadows. A bearded man rose up in his path, half-crouched, lunging\\nforward with a weapon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the sternum with a\\nstraight-hand jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck, relieving him\\nof the weapon as he fell.\\nThen Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the\\nweapon tucked into his waist sash. He had recognized it in spite of its\\nunfamiliar shape--a projectile weapon, and that said many things about this\\nplace, another clue that shields were not used here.\\nThey will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow. She can handle\\nhim. I must get to a safe vantage point where I can threaten them and give her\\ntime to escape.\\nThere came a chorus of sharp spring-clicks from the basin. Projectiles\\nwhined off the rocks around him. One of them flicked his robe. He squeezed\\naround a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began\\ninching upward--his back against one side, his feet against the other--slowly,\\nas silently as he could.\\nThe roar of Stilgar\\'s voice echoed up to him: \"Get back, you wormheaded\\nlice! She\\'ll break my neck if you come near!\"\\nA voice out of the basin said: \"The boy got away, Stil. What are we--\"\\n\"Of course he got away, you sand-brained . . . Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman!\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Tell them to stop hunting my son,\" Jessica said.\\n\"They\\'ve stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great gods\\nbelow! Why didn\\'t you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?\"\\n\"Tell your men to fall back,\" Jessica said. \"Tell them to go out into the\\nbasin where I can see them . . . and you\\'d better believe that I know how many\\nof them there are.\"\\nAnd she thought: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-minded as I think him, we have a chance.\\nPaul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and\\nlook down into the basin. Stilgar\\'s voice came up to him.\\n\"And if I refuse? How can you . . . ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no\\nharm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us, you\\'re\\nworth ten times your weight of water.\"\\nNow, the test of reason, Jessica thought. She said: \"You ask after the Lisan\\nal-Gaib.\"\\n\"You could be the folk of the legend,\" he said, \"but I\\'ll believe that when\\nit\\'s been tested. All I know now is that you came here with that stupid Duke who\\n. . . Aiee-e-e! Woman! I care not if you kill me! He was honorable and brave,\\nbut it was stupid to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!\"\\nSilence.\\nPresently, Jessica said: \"He had no choice, but we\\'ll not argue it. Now,\\ntell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to bring his\\nweapon to bear on me, or I\\'ll rid the universe of you and take him next.\"\\n\"You there!\" Stilgar roared. \"Do as she says!\"\\n\"But, Stil--\"\\n\"Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained piece of lizard turd!\\nDo it or I\\'ll help her dismember you! Can\\'t you see the worth of this woman?\"\\nThe man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered his\\nweapon.\\n\"He has obeyed,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"Now,\" Jessica said, \"explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of\\nme. I want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake.\"\\n\"When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend\\nwith the pan and graben folk,\" Stilgar said. \"We carry no weapons, for the\\ncrysknife is sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirding ability of battle.\\nWe\\'d only heard of it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt what he sees with\\nhis own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen. This is a weapon no search could\\nexpose.\"\\nThere was a stirring in the basin as Stilgar\\'s words sank home.\\n\"And if I agree to teach you the . . . weirding way?\"\\n\"My countenance for you as well as your son.\"\\n\"How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?\"\\nStilgar\\'s voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on an\\nedge of bitterness. \"Out here, woman, we carry no paper for contracts. We make\\nno evening promises to be broken at dawn. When a man says a thing, that\\'s the\\ncontract. As leader of my people, I\\'ve put them in bond to my word. Teach us\\nthis weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as you wish. Your water\\nshall mingle with our water.\"\\n\"Can you speak for all Fremen?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"In time, that may be. But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen.\\nHere, I promise only secrecy. My people will not speak of you to any other\\nsietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your Duke is dead. It\\nis said that you two died in a Mother storm. The hunter does not seek dead\\ngame.\"\\nThere\\'s safety in that, Jessica thought. But these people have good\\ncommunications and a message could be sent.\\n\"I presume there was a reward offered for us,\" she said.\\n\\n\\x0cStilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning over\\nin his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands.\\nPresently, he said: \"I will say it once more: I\\'ve given the tribe\\'s word bond. My people know your worth to us now. What could the Harkonnens give us?\\nOur freedom? Hah! no, you are the taqwa, that which buys us more than all the\\nspice in the Harkonnen coffers.\"\\n\"Then I shall teach you my way of battle,\" Jessica said, and she sensed the\\nunconscious ritual-intensity of her own words.\\n\"Now, will you release me?\"\\n\"So be it,\" Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in\\nfull view of the bank in the basin. This is the test-mashed, she thought. But\\nPaul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.\\nIn the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of where\\nhis mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathing, suddenly stilled, above\\nhim in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint shadow there outlined\\nagainst the stars.\\nStilgar\\'s voice came up from the basin: \"You, up there! Stop hunting the\\nboy. He\\'ll come down presently.\"\\nThe voice of a young boy or a girl sounded from the darkness above Paul:\\n\"But, Stil, he can\\'t be far from--\"\\n\"I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!\"\\nThere came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: \"Call me\\nspawn of a lizard!\" But the shadow pulled back out of view.\\nPaul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed\\nmovement of Stilgar beside his mother.\\n\"Come in, all of you,\" Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. \"And now I\\'ll\\nask you how we may be certain you\\'ll fulfill your half of our bargain? You\\'re\\nthe one\\'s lived with papers and empty contracts and such as--\"\\n\"We of the Bene Gesserit don\\'t break our vows any more than you do,\" Jessica\\nsaid.\\nThere was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: \"A Bene\\nGesserit witch!\"\\nPaul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark\\nfigure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained immobile, staring at\\nJessica.\\n\"It is the legend,\" someone said.\\n\"It was said that the Shadout Mapes gave this report on you,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"But a thing so important must be tested. If you are the Bene Gesserit of the\\nlegend whose son will lead us to paradise . . . \" He shrugged.\\nJessica sighed, thinking: So our Missionaria Protectiva even planted\\nreligious safety valves all through this hell hole. Ah, well . . . it\\'ll help,\\nand that\\'s what it was meant to do.\\nShe said: \"The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the\\nbinding of karama and ijaz, the miracle and the inimitability of the prophecy-this I know. Do you wish a sign?\"\\nHis nostrils flared in the moonlight. \"We cannot tarry for the rites,\" he\\nwhispered.\\nJessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency\\nescape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called \"Sietch\\nTabr\" on the chart and beside it the notation: \"Stilgar.\"\\n\"Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr,\" she said.\\nThe revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: If only he knew the tricks we\\nuse! She must\\'ve been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva.\\nThese Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.\\nStilgar shifted uneasily. \"We must go now.\"\\nShe nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.\\n\\n\\x0cHe looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul\\ncrouched. \"You there, lad: you may come down now.\" He returned his attention to\\nJessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: \"Your son made an incredible amount of\\nnoise climbing. He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but he\\'s young.\"\\n\"No doubt we have much to teach each other,\" Jessica said. \"Meanwhile, you\\'d\\nbest see to your companion out there. My noisy son was a bit rough in disarming\\nhim.\"\\nStilgar whirled, his hood flapping. \"Where?\"\\n\"Beyond those bushes.\" She pointed.\\nStilgar touched two of his men. \"See to it.\" He glanced at his companions,\\nidentifying them. \"Jamis is missing.\" He turned to Jessica. \"Even your cub knows\\nthe weirding way.\"\\n\"And you\\'ll notice that my son hasn\\'t stirred from up there as you ordered,\"\\nJessica said.\\nThe two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and\\ngasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned his attention\\nto Jessica. \"The son will take only your orders, eh? Good. He knows discipline.\"\\n\"Paul, you may come down now,\" Jessica said.\\nPaul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped\\nthe Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another figure arose from\\nthe rocks to face him.\\nIn the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure in\\nFremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the muzzle\\nof one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.\\n\"I am Chani, daughter of Liet.\"\\nThe voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.\\n\"I would not have permitted you to harm my companions,\" she said.\\nPaul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon\\'s path and\\nhe saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that face, the\\nfeatures out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to\\nstillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this\\nface-from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gains Helen Mohiam: \"I will meet\\nher.\"\\nAnd here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.\\n\"You were as noisy as shai-hulud in a rage,\" she said. \"And you took the\\nmost difficult way up here. Follow me; I\\'ll show you an easier way down.\"\\nHe scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a\\ntumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks. Paul felt\\nhot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.\\nThat girl! She was like a touch of destiny. He felt caught up on a wave, in\\ntune with a motion that lifted all his spirits.\\nThey stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor.\\nJessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: \"This will be a\\ngood exchange of teachings. I hope you and your people feel no anger at our\\nviolence. It seemed . . . necessary. You were about to . . . make a mistake.\"\\n\"To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise,\" Stilgar said. He touched\\nhis lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon from Paul\\'s waist with the other,\\ntossed it to a companion. \"You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when you\\'ve\\nearned it.\"\\nPaul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother\\'s teaching:\\n\"Beginnings are such delicate times. \"\\n\"My son has what weapons he needs,\" Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar,\\nforcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.\\nStilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued--Jamis. The man stood at one\\nside, head lowered, breathing heavily. \"You are a difficult woman,\" Stilgar\\nsaid. He held out his left hand to a companion, snapped his fingers. \"Kushti\\nbakka te.\"\\n\\n\\x0cMore Chakobsa, Jessica thought.\\nThe companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar\\'s hand. Stilgar ran\\nthem through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica\\'s neck beneath her hood,\\nfitted the other around Paul\\'s neck in the same way.\\n\"Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka,\" he said. \"If we become separated,\\nyou will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar\\'s sietch. We will talk of weapons\\nanother time.\"\\nHe moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul\\'s Fremkit\\npack to one of his men to carry.\\nBakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka--the weeper.\\nShe sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. Why should\\nweeping unite them? she asked herself.\\nStilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: \"Chani, take\\nthe child-man under your wing. Keep him out of trouble.\"\\nChani touched Paul\\'s arm. \"Come along, child-man.\"\\nPaul hid the anger in his voice, said: \"My name is Paul. It were well you--\"\\n\"We\\'ll give you a name, manling,\" Stilgar said, \"in the time of the mihna,\\nat the test of aql.\"\\nThe test of reason, Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul\\'s ascendancy\\noverrode all other consideration, and she barked, \"My son\\'s been tested with the\\ngom jabbar!\"\\nIn the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of\\nthem.\\n\"There\\'s much we don\\'t know of each other,\" Stilgar said. \"But we tarry\\noverlong. Day-sun mustn\\'t find us in the open.\" He crossed to the man Paul had\\nstruck down, said, \"Jamis, can you travel?\"\\nA grunt answered him. \"Surprised me, he did. \\'Twas an accident. I can\\ntravel.\"\\n\"No accident,\" Stilgar said. \"I\\'ll hold you responsible with Chani for the\\nlad\\'s safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance.\"\\nJessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with\\nStilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death in it. And Stilgar had seen\\nfit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.\\nStilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out.\\n\"Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no trace.\\nExtra care--we have two with us who\\'ve not been trained.\" He turned, hand upheld\\nand aimed across the basin. \"In squad line with flankers--move out. We must be\\nat Cave of the Ridges before dawn.\"\\nJessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty\\nFremen--she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought: They travel as a\\nmilitary company--even the girl, Chani.\\nPaul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black\\nfeeling at being caught by the girl. In his mind now was the memory called up by\\nhis mother\\'s barked reminder: \"My son\\'s been tested with the gom jabbar!\" He\\nfound that his hand tingled with remembered pain.\\n\"Watch where you go,\" Chani hissed. \"Do not brush against a bush lest you\\nleave a thread to show our passage.\"\\nPaul swallowed, nodded.\\nJessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and\\nPaul\\'s, marveling at the way the Fremen moved. They were forty people crossing\\nthe basin with only the sounds natural to the place--ghostly feluccas, their\\nrobes flitting through the shadows. Their destination was Sietch Tabr--Stilgar\\'s\\nsietch.\\nShe turned the word over in her mind; sietch. It was a Chakobsa word,\\nunchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries. Sietch: a\\nmeeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of the word and the\\n\\n\\x0clanguage were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their\\nencounter.\\n\"We move well,\" Stilgar said. \"With, Shai-hulud\\'s favor, we\\'ll reach Cave of\\nthe Ridges before dawn.\"\\nJessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she\\nheld at bay by force of will . . . and, she admitted it: by the force of\\nelation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed\\nhere about the Fremen culture.\\nAll of them, she thought, an entire culture trained to military order. What\\na priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!\\n', 33: '\\nThe Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called \"spannungsbogen\"-which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of\\nreaching out to grasp that thing.\\n-from \"The Wisdom of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThey approached Cave of the Ridges at dawnbreak, moving through a split in\\nthe basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it. Jessica saw\\nStilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began\\ntheir scrambling climb up the cliff.\\nPaul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this planet\\ncut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray-blue sky.\\nChani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: \"Quickly. It is already light.\"\\n\"The men who climbed above us, where are they going?\" Paul whispered.\\n\"The first daywatch,\" she said. \"Hurry now!\"\\nA guard left outside, Paul thought. Wise. But it would\\'ve been wiser still\\nfor us to approach this place in separate bands. Less chance of losing the whole\\ntroop. He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and\\nhe remembered his father\\'s fear that the Atreides might become a guerrilla\\nhouse.\\n\"Faster,\" Chani whispered.\\nPaul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought of\\nthe words of the sirat from Yueh\\'s tiny 0.C. Bible.\\n\"Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind.\" He\\nrolled the quotation in his mind.\\nThey rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one side\\nmotioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.\\n\"Quickly!\" he hissed. \"We\\'re like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us\\nhere.\"\\nPaul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin\\ngray light from somewhere ahead.\\n\"You can stand up,\" she said.\\nHe straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling\\nthat curved away just out of a man\\'s handreach. The troop spread out through\\nshadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their\\ncompanions. And he noted how she failed to blend with the Fremen even though her\\ngarb was identical. The way she moved--such a sense of power and grace.\\n\"Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child-man,\" Chani said.\\n\"Here\\'s food.\" She pressed two leaf-wrapped morsels into his hand. They reeked\\nof spice.\\nStilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left. \"Get\\nthe doorseal in place and see to moisture security.\" He turned to another\\nFremen: \"Lemil, get glowglobes.\" He took Jessica\\'s arm. \"I wish to show you\\nsomething, weirding woman.\" He led her around a curve of rock toward the light\\nsource.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to\\nthe cave, an opening high in a cliff wall--looking out across another basin\\nabout ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was shielded by high rock walls.\\nSparse clumps of plant growth were scattered around it.\\nAs she looked at the dawn-gray basin, the sun lifted over the far escarpment\\nilluminating a biscuit-colored landscape of rocks and sand. And she noted how\\nthe sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.\\nIt\\'s because we want to hold it back, she thought. Night is safer than day.\\nThere came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never\\nsee rain. I must suppress such longings, she thought. They\\'re a weakness. I no\\nlonger can afford weaknesses.\\nStilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin. \"There! There you see\\nproper Druses.\"\\nShe looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor\\nscattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliffwall. In spite\\nof the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air. She lifted her\\nbinoculars from beneath her robe, focused the oil lenses on the distant people.\\nKerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies.\\n\"That is home,\" Stilgar said. \"We will be there this night.\" He stared\\nacross the basin, tugging at his mustache. \"My people stayed out overlate\\nworking. That means there are no patrols about. I\\'ll signal them later and\\nthey\\'ll prepare for us.\"\\n\"Your people show good discipline,\" Jessica said. She lowered the\\nbinoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.\\n\"They obey the preservation of the tribe,\" he said. \"It is the way we choose\\namong us for a leader. The leader is the one who is strongest, the one who\\nbrings water and security.\" He lifted his attention to her face.\\nShe returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits, the\\ndust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the catchtube curving down from his\\nnostrils into his stillsuit.\\n\"Have I compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?\" she asked.\\n\"You did not call me out,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s important that a leader keep the respect of his troop,\" she said.\\n\"Isn\\'t a one of those sandlice I cannot handle,\" Stilgar said. \"When you\\nbested me, you bested us all. Now, they hope to learn from you . . . the\\nweirding way . . . and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out.\"\\nShe weighed the implications. \"By besting you in formal battle?\"\\nHe nodded. \"I\\'d advise you against this because they\\'d not follow you.\\nYou\\'re not of the sand. They saw this in our night\\'s passage.\"\\n\"Practical people,\" she said.\\n\"True enough.\" He glanced at the basin. \"We know our needs. But not many are\\nthinking deep thoughts now this close to home. We\\'ve been out overlong arranging\\nto deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed Guild . . . may\\ntheir faces be forever black.\"\\nJessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into his\\nface. \"The Guild? What has the Guild to do with your spice?\"\\n\"It\\'s Liet\\'s command,\" Stilgar said. \"We know the reason, but the taste of\\nit sours us. We bribe the Guild with a monstrous payment in spice to keep our\\nskies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of\\nArrakis.\"\\nShe weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be the\\nreason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. \"And what is it you do to the\\nface of Arrakis that must not be seen?\"\\n\"We change it . . . slowly but with certainty . . . to make it fit for human\\nlife. Our generation will not see it, nor our children nor our children\\'s\\nchildren nor the grandchildren of their children . . . but it will come.\" He\\n\\n\\x0cstared with veiled eyes out over the basin. \"Open water and tall green plants\\nand people walking freely without stillsuits.\"\\nSo that\\'s the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thought. And she said: \"Bribes\\nare dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger.\"\\n\"They grow,\" he said, \"but the slow way is the safe way.\"\\nJessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way Stilgar\\nwas seeing it in his imagination. She saw only the grayed mustard stain of\\ndistant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs.\\n\"Ah-h-h-h,\" Stilgar said.\\nShe thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a\\nmirage--another landscape hovering over the desert-sand and a distant wavering\\nof greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with\\nwhat looked like Fremen robes fluttering on its back.\\nThe mirage faded.\\n\"It would be better to ride,\" Stilgar said, \"but we cannot permit a maker\\ninto this basin. Thus, we must walk again tonight.\"\\nMaker--their word for worm, she thought.\\nShe measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not\\npermit a worm into this basin. She knew what she had seen in the mirage--Fremen\\nriding on the back of a giant worm. It took heavy control not to betray her\\nshock at the implications.\\n\"We must be getting back to the others,\" Stilgar said. \"Else my people may\\nsuspect I dally with you. Some already are jealous that my hands tasted your\\nloveliness when we struggled last night in Tuono Basin.\"\\n\"That will be enough of that!\" Jessica snapped.\\n\"No offense,\" Stilgar said, and his voice was mild. \"Women among us are not\\ntaken against their will . . . and with you . . . \" He shrugged. \". . . even\\nthat convention isn\\'t required.\"\\n\"You will keep in mind that I was a duke\\'s lady,\" she said, but her voice\\nwas calmer.\\n\"As you wish,\" he said. \"It\\'s time to seal off this opening, to permit\\nrelaxation of stillsuit discipline. My people need to rest in comfort this day.\\nTheir families will give them little rest on the morrow.\"\\nSilence fell between them.\\nJessica stared out into the sunlight. She had heard what she had heard in\\nStilgar\\'s voice--the unspoken offer of more than his countenance. Did he need a\\nwife? She realized she could step into that place with him. It would be one way\\nto end conflict over tribal leadership--female properly aligned with male.\\nBut what of Paul then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed\\nhere? And what of the unborn daughter she had carried these few weeks? What of a\\ndead Duke\\'s daughter? And she permitted herself to face fully the significance\\nof this other child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the\\nconception. She knew what it was--she had succumbed to that profound drive\\nshared by all creatures who are faced with death--the drive to seek immortality\\nthrough progeny. The fertility drive of the species had overpowered them.\\nJessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting. A\\ndaughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man--what would be the\\nfate of such a daughter? she asked herself. Would he try to limit the\\nnecessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?\\nStilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the\\nquestions in her mind. \"What is important for a leader is that which makes him a\\nleader. It is the needs of his people. If you teach me your powers, there may\\ncome a day when one of us must challenge the other. I would prefer some\\nalternative.\"\\n\"There are several alternatives?\" she asked.\\n\"The Sayyadina,\" he said. \"Our Reverend Mother is old.\"\\nTheir Reverend Mother!\\n\\n\\x0cBefore she could probe this, he said: \"I do not necessarily offer myself as\\nmate. This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful and desirable. But should\\nyou become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to believe that\\nI\\'m too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with\\nthe tribe\\'s needs. Even now they listen to us and watch us.\"\\nA man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought.\\n\"There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild\\nspirits,\" he said. \"They must be eased through this period. I must leave no\\ngreat reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to maim and\\nkill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided\\nwith honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob\\nfrom a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a\\npeople reverts to a mob.\"\\nHis words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to\\nher as to those who secretly listened, forced her to reevaluate him.\\nHe has stature, she thought. Where did he learn such inner balance?\\n\"The law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law,\" Stilgar\\nsaid. \"But it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs.\\nWhat we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over\\nmore land.\"\\nWhat is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She said:\\n\"Stilgar, I underestimated you.\"\\n\"Such was my suspicion,\" he said.\\n\"Each of us apparently underestimated the other,\" she said.\\n\"I should like an end to this,\" he said. \"I should like friendship with you\\n. . . and trust. I should like that respect for each other which grows in the\\nbreast without demand for the huddlings of sex.\"\\n\"I understand,\" she said.\\n\"Do you trust me?\"\\n\"I hear your sincerity.\"\\n\"Among us,\" he said, \"the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders,\\nhold a special place of honor. They teach. They maintain the strength of God\\nhere.\" He touched his breast.\\nNow I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery, she thought. And she said:\\n\"You spoke of your Reverend Mother . . . and I\\'ve heard words of legend and\\nprophecy.\"\\n\"It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our\\nfuture,\" he said.\\n\"Do you believe I am that one.\"\\nShe watched his face, thinking; The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings\\nare times of such great peril.\\n\"We do not know,\" he said.\\nShe nodded, thinking: He\\'s an honorable man. He wants a sign from me, but\\nhe\\'ll not tip fate by telling me the sign.\\nJessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows,\\nthe purple shadows, the vibrations of dust-mote air across the lip of their\\ncave. Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence. She knew the cant of\\nthe Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear\\nand hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes here . . . as\\nthough someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria\\nProtectiva\\'s imprint.\\nStilgar cleared his throat.\\nShe sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to\\nseal off this opening. This was a time for boldness on her part, and she\\nrealized what she needed: some dar al-hikman, some school of translation that\\nwould give her . . .\\n\"Adab,\" she whispered.\\n\\n\\x0cHer mind felt as though it had rolled over within her. She recognized the\\nsensation with a quickening of pulse. Nothing in all the Bene Gesserit training\\ncarried such a signal of recognition. It could be only the adab, the demanding\\nmemory that comes upon you of itself. She gave herself up to it, allowing the\\nwords to flow from her.\\n\"Ibn qirtaiba,\" she said, \"as far as the spot where the dust ends.\" She\\nstretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgar\\'s eyes go wide. She heard a\\nrustling of many robes in the background. \"I see a . . . Fremen with the book of\\nexamples,\" she intoned. \"He reads to al-Lat, the sun whom he defied and\\nsubjugated. He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads;\\n\"Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down\\nThat did stand in the path of the tempest.\\nHast thou not seen what our Lord did?\\nHe sent the pestilence among them\\nThat did lay schemes against us.\\nThey are like birds scattered by the huntsman.\\nTheir schemes are like pellets of poison\\nThat every mouth rejects.\"\\nA trembling passed through her. She dropped her arm.\\nBack to her from the inner cave\\'s shadows came a whispered response of many\\nvoices: \"Their works have been overturned.\"\\n\"The fire of God mount over thy heart,\" she said. And she thought: Now, it\\ngoes in the proper channel.\\n\"The fire of God set alight,\" came the response.\\nShe nodded. \"Thine enemies shall fall,\" she said.\\n\"Bi-la kaifa,\" they answered.\\nIn the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her. \"Sayyadina,\" he said. \"If the\\nShai-hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to become a Reverend Mother.\"\\nPass within, she thought. An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it\\nfitted into the cant well enough. And she felt a cynical bitterness at what she\\nhad done. Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was prepared for us\\nin this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place. Now\\n. . . I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God . . . Sayyadina to rogue\\npeoples who\\'ve been so heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they\\neven call their chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.\\nPaul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave. He could still\\ntaste the morsel she had fed him--bird flesh and grain bound with spice honey\\nand encased in a leaf. In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten\\nsuch a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear. He\\nknew what this essence could do to him--the spice change that pushed his mind\\ninto prescient awareness.\\n\"Bi-la kaifa,\" Chani whispered.\\nHe looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept\\nhis mother\\'s words. Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand aloof from the\\nceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.\\n\"Duy yakha bin mange,\" Chani whispered. \"Duy punra bin mange. I have two\\neyes. I have two feet.\"\\nAnd she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.\\nPaul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him. His\\nmother\\'s words had locked onto the working of the spice essence, and he had felt\\nher voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire. Through it\\nall, he had sensed the edge of cynicism in her--he knew her so well!--but\\nnothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food.\\nTerrible purpose!\\n\\n\\x0cHe sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape. There was the\\nsharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of his awareness. He\\nsank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it.\\nAwareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing\\nthe available paths, the winds of the future . . . the winds of the past: the\\none-eyed vision of the past, the one-eyed vision of the present and the one-eyed\\nvision of the future--all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to\\nsee time-become-space.\\nThere was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto\\nhis awareness of the present, sensing the blurred deflection of experience, the\\nflowing moment, the continual solidification of that-which-is into the\\nperpetual-was.\\nIn grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness\\nof time\\'s movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges,\\nand countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs. It gave him a new\\nunderstanding of his prescience, and he saw the source of blind time, the source\\nof error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.\\nThe prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the\\nlimits of what it revealed--at once a source of accuracy and meaningful error. A\\nkind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that\\nrevealed what he saw, changed what he saw.\\nAnd what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of\\npossibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action--the wink of an eye,\\na careless word, a misplaced grain of sand--moved a gigantic lever across the\\nknown universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables\\nthat his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.\\nThe vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was\\naction with its consequences.\\nThe countless consequences--lines fanned out from this cave, and along most\\nof these consequence-lines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a\\ngaping knife wound.\\n', 34: '\\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he\\nencompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He\\nseldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg\\'s\\nblack helmet with the imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an\\nopen reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though.\\nWhen he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in\\nthese later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a\\nman fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must\\nremember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into\\nthe dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most\\nterrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors\\nwhere the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History\\nalready has answered.\\n-\"In My Father\\'s House\" by the Princess Irulan\\nJessica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir of Fremen around her,\\nsmelling the acrid stillsuit odor. Her inner timesense told her it would soon be\\nnight outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by\\nthe plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space.\\nShe realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of\\ngreat fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on\\npersonal security within Stilgar\\'s troop. She turned in the hammock that had\\n\\n\\x0cbeen fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her\\ndesert boots.\\nI must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit\\'s\\npumping action, she thought. There are so many things to remember.\\nShe could still taste their morning meal--the morsel of bird flesh and grain\\nbound within a leaf with spice honey--and it came to her that the use of time\\nwas turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of\\nrest.\\nNight conceals; night is safest.\\nShe unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with\\nthe fabric in the dark until she found the top, slipped into it.\\nHow to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit? she wondered. They would have\\nto be told of the two strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.\\nGlowglobes came alight farther into the cave. She saw people moving there,\\nPaul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the\\naquiline Atreides profile.\\nHe had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought. Withdrawn. He\\nwas like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his\\neyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare. It made her think of his\\nwarning about the spice-impregnated diet: addictive.\\nAre there side effects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with\\nhis prescient faculty, but he has been strangely silent about what he sees.\\nStilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the\\nglowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat-stalking\\nlook of him.\\nAbrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions\\nvisible in the people gathered around Paul--the stiff movements, the ritual\\npositions.\\n\"They have my countenance!\" Stilgar rumbled.\\nJessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted--Jamis! She saw then the rage\\nin Jamis--the tight set of his shoulders.\\nJamis, the man Paul bested! she thought.\\n\"You know the rule, Stilgar,\" Jamis said.\\n\"Who knows it better?\" Stilgar asked, and she heard the tone of placation in\\nhis voice, the attempt to smooth something over.\\n\"I choose the combat,\" Jamis growled.\\nJessica sped across the cave, grasped Stilgar\\'s arm. \"What is this?\" she\\nasked.\\n\"It is the amtal rule,\" Stilgar said. \"Jamis is demanding the right to test\\nyour part in the legend.\"\\n\"She must be championed,\" Jamis said. \"If her champion wins, that\\'s the\\ntruth in it. But it\\'s said . . . \" He glanced across the press of people. \" . .\\n. that she\\'d need no champion from the Fremen--which can mean only that she\\nbrings her own champion.\"\\nHe\\'s talking of single combat with Paul! Jessica thought.\\nShe released Stilgar\\'s arm, took a half-step forward. \"I\\'m always my own\\nchampion,\" she said. \"The meaning\\'s simple enough for . . . \"\\n\"You\\'ll not tell us our ways!\" Jamis snapped. \"Not without more proof than\\nI\\'ve seen. Stilgar could\\'ve told you what to say last morning. He could\\'ve\\nfilled your mind full of the coddle and you could\\'ve bird-talked it to us,\\nhoping to make a false way among us.\"\\nI can take him, Jessica thought, but that might conflict with the way they\\ninterpret the legend. And again she wondered at the way the Missionaria\\nProtectiva\\'s work had been twisted on this planet.\\nStilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to\\nthe crowd\\'s fringe. \"Jamis is one to hold a grudge, Sayyadina. Your son bested\\nhim and--\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"It was an accident!\" Jamis roared. \"There was witch-force at Tuono Basin\\nand I\\'ll prove it now!\"\\n\" . . . and I\\'ve bested him myself,\" Stilgar continued. \"He seeks by this\\ntahaddi challenge to get back at me as well. There\\'s too much of violence in\\nJamis for him ever to make a good leader--too much ghafla, the distraction. He\\ngives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarfa, the turning away. No,\\nhe could never make a good leader. I\\'ve preserved him this long because he\\'s\\nuseful in a fight as such, but when he gets this carving anger on him he\\'s\\ndangerous to his own society.\"\\n\"Stilgar-r-r-r!\" Jamis rumbled.\\nAnd Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take the\\nchallenge away from Paul.\\nStilgar faced Jamis, and again Jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling\\nvoice. \"Jamis, he\\'s but a boy. He\\'s--\"\\n\"You named him a man,\" Jamis said. \"His mother says he\\'s been through the\\ngom jabbar. He\\'s full-fleshed and with a surfeit of water. The ones who carried\\ntheir pack say there\\'s literjons of water in it. Literjons! And us sipping our\\ncatch-pockets the instant they show dewsparkle.\"\\nStilgar glanced at Jessica. \"Is this true? Is there water in your pack?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Literjons of it?\"\\n\"Two literjons.\"\\n\"What was intended with this wealth?\"\\nWealth? she thought. She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice.\\n\"Where I was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide\\nrivers,\" she said. \"There were oceans of it so broad you could not see the other\\nshore. I\\'ve not been trained to your water discipline. I never before had to\\nthink of it this way.\"\\nA sighing gasp arose from the people around them: \"Water fell from the sky .\\n. . it ran over the land.\"\\n\"Did you know there\\'re those among us who\\'ve lost from their catch-pockets\\nby accident and will be in sore trouble before we reach Tabr this night?\"\\n\"How could I know?\" Jessica shook her head. \"If they\\'re in need, give them\\nwater from our pack.\"\\n\"Is that what you intended with this wealth?\"\\n\"I intended it to save life,\" she said.\\n\"Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina.\"\\n\"You\\'ll not buy us off with water,\" Jamis growled. \"Nor will you anger me\\nagainst yourself, Stilgar. I see you trying to make me call you out before I\\'ve\\nproved my words,\"\\nStilgar faced Jamis. \"Are you determined to press this fight against a\\nchild, Jamis?\" His voice was low, venomous.\\n\"She must be championed.\"\\n\"Even though she has my countenance?\"\\n\"I invoke the amtal rule,\" Jamis said. \"It\\'s my right.\"\\nStilgar nodded. \"Then, if the boy does not carve you down, you\\'ll answer to\\nmy knife afterward. And this time I\\'ll not hold back the blade as I\\'ve done\\nbefore.\"\\n\"You cannot do this thing,\" Jessica said. \"Paul\\'s just--\"\\n\"You must not interfere, Sayyadina,\" Stilgar said. \"Oh, I know you can take\\nme and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but you cannot best us all united.\\nThis must be; it is the amtal rule.\"\\nJessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes,\\nseeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his expression. She shifted\\nher attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: I\\nshould\\'ve seen that before. He broods. He\\'s the silent kind, one who works\\nhimself up inside. I should\\'ve been prepared.\\n\\n\\x0c\"If you harm my son,\" she said, \"You\\'ll have me to meet. I call you out now.\\nI\\'ll carve you into a joint of--\"\\n\"Mother.\" Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. \"Perhaps if I explain to\\nJamis how--\"\\n\"Explain!\" Jamis sneered.\\nPaul fell silent, staring at the man. He felt no fear of him. Jamis appeared\\nclumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their night encounter on\\nthe sand. But Paul still felt the nexus-boiling of this cave, still remembered\\nthe prescient visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so few\\navenues of escape for him in that vision . . .\\nStilgar said: \"Sayyadina, you must step back now where--\"\\n\"Stop calling her Sayyadina!\" Jamis said. \"That\\'s yet to be proved. So she\\nknows the prayer! What\\'s that? Every child among us knows it.\"\\nHe has talked enough, Jessica thought. I\\'ve the key to him. I could\\nimmobilize him with a word. She hesitated. But I cannot stop them all.\\n\"You will answer to me then,\" Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in a\\ntwisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end.\\nJamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.\\n\"I\\'ll teach you agony,\" she said in the same tone. \"Remember that as you\\nfight. You\\'ll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by\\ncomparison. You will writhe with your entire--\"\\n\"She tries a spell on me!\" Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist\\nbeside his ear. \"I invoke the silence on her!\"\\n\"So be it then,\" Stilgar said. He cast a warning glance at Jessica. \"If you\\nspeak again, Sayyadina, we\\'ll know it\\'s your witchcraft and you\\'ll be forfeit.\"\\nHe nodded for her to step back.\\nJessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they were\\nnot unkindly. She saw Paul being separated from the throng, the elfin-faced\\nChani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.\\nA ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of them\\ntuned to the yellow band.\\nJamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to\\nsomeone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit\\nthat was patched and marked by tucks and gathers. For a moment, he bent with his\\nmouth to his shoulder, drinking from a catchpocket tube. Presently he\\nstraightened, peeled off and detached the suit, handed it carefully into the\\ncrowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet,\\na crysknife in his right hand.\\nJessica saw the girl-child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife\\nhandle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the weight and balance. And it\\ncame to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu, the nerve and the\\nfiber--that he had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers men\\nlike Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in their own\\nlifetimes. The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked\\nsupple and confident.\\nBut he\\'s only fifteen, she thought. And he has no shield. I must stop this.\\nSomehow, there must be a way to . . . She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.\\n\"You cannot stop it,\" he said. \"You must not speak.\"\\nShe put a hand over her mouth, thinking: I\\'ve planted fear in Jamis\\' mind.\\nIt\\'ll slow him some . . . perhaps. If I could only pray--truly pray.\\nPaul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks he\\'d\\nworn under his stillsuit. He held a crysknife in his right hand; his feet were\\nbare against the sand-gritted rock. Idaho had warned him time and again: \"When\\nin doubt of your surface, bare feet are best.\" And there were Chani\\'s words of\\ninstruction still in the front of his consciousness: \"Jamis turns to the right\\nwith his knife after a parry. It\\'s a habit in him we\\'ve all seen. And he\\'ll aim\\n\\n\\x0cfor the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you. And he can fight either\\nhand; took out for a knife shift.\"\\nBut strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was training\\nand the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after\\nday, hour after hour on the practice floor.\\nGurney Halleck\\'s words were there to remember: \"The good knife fighter\\nthinks on point and blade and shearing-guard simultaneously. The point can also\\ncut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent\\'s\\nblade.\"\\nPaul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim\\nround ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so,\\nhe realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not\\neven know if it could be broken.\\nJamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.\\nPaul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to\\nfighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with\\nutmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness\\nnecessary for penetrating the enemy\\'s shield. In spite of constant warning from\\nhis trainers not to depend on the shield\\'s mindless blunting of attack speed, he\\nknew that shield-awareness was part of him.\\nJamis called out in ritual challenge: \"May thy knife chip and shatter!\"\\nThis knife will break then, Paul thought.\\nHe cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man wasn\\'t\\ntrained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.\\nPaul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man\\'s body looked like knotted\\nwhipcord on a dried skeleton. His crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of\\nthe glowglobes.\\nFear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull\\nyellow light within this ring of people. Prescience had fed his knowledge with\\ncountless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the\\nstrings of decision that guided them, but this was the real-now. This was death\\nhanging on an infinite number of miniscule mischances.\\nAnything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the\\ntroop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in a glowglobe\\'s brilliance, a\\ndeceptive shadow.\\nI\\'m afraid, Paul told himself.\\nAnd he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating silently to himself the Bene\\nGesserit litany against fear. \"Fear is the mind-killer . . . \" It was a cool\\nbath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and\\nready.\\n\"I\\'ll sheath my knife in your blood,\" Jamis snarled. And in the middle of\\nthe last word he pounced.\\nJessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.\\nWhere the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind\\nJamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.\\nNow, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind.\\nPaul\\'s motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis\\nthe margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.\\nPaul withdrew, crouching low. \"First, you must find my blood,\" he said.\\nJessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came over\\nher what a two-edged thing that was. The boy\\'s reactions were those of youth and\\ntrained to a peak these people had never seen. But the attack was trained, too,\\nand conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier. A shield\\nwould repel too fast a blow, admit only the slowly deceptive counter. It needed\\ncontrol and trickery to get through a shield.\\nDoes Paul see it? she asked herself. He must!\\n\\n\\x0cAgain Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under\\nthe glowglobes.\\nAnd again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.\\nAnd again.\\nAnd again.\\nEach time, Paul\\'s counterblow came an instant late.\\nAnd Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul\\'s defensive\\nreactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the precisely\\ncorrect angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis\\'\\nblow.\\n\"Is your son playing with that poor fool?\" Stilgar asked. He waved her to\\nsilence before she could respond. \"Sorry; you must remain silent.\"\\nNow the two figures on the rock floor circled each other; Jamis with knife\\nhand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low.\\nAgain, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had\\nbeen dodging.\\nInstead of faking back and out, Paul met the man\\'s knife hand on the point\\nof his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left and thankful\\nfor Chani\\'s warning.\\nJamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand. Blood\\ndripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His eyes were wide and staring-two blue-black holes--studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the\\nglowglobes.\\n\"Ah, that one hurt,\" Stilgar murmured.\\nPaul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first\\nblood, called out: \"Do you yield?\"\\n\"Hah!\" Jamis cried.\\nAn angry murmur arose from the troop.\\n\"Hold!\" Stilgar called out. \"The lad doesn\\'t know our rule.\" Then, to Paul:\\n\"There can be no yielding in the tahaddi-challenge. Death is the test of it.\"\\nJessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: He\\'s never killed a man like\\nthis . . . in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?\\nPaul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis\\' movement. The prescient\\nknowledge of the time-boiling variables in this cave came back to plague him\\nnow. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed\\ndecisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself.\\nVariable piled on variable--that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in\\nhis path. It was like a gigantic rock in the flood, creating maelstroms in the\\ncurrent around it.\\n\"Have an end to it, lad,\" Stilgar muttered. \"Don\\'t play with him.\"\\nPaul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.\\nJamis backed now that the realization swept over him--that this was no soft\\noffworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen crysknife.\\nJessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man\\'s face. Now is when he\\'s\\nmost dangerous, she thought. Now he\\'s desperate and can do anything. He sees\\nthat this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and\\ntrained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.\\nAnd she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis--an emotion tempered by\\nawareness of the immediate peril to her son.\\nJamis could do anything . . . any unpredictable thing, she told herself. She\\nwondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this\\nexperience. But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his\\nface and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles. And for\\nthe first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in\\nPaul\\'s gift.\\nPaul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear\\nin his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho\\'s voice flowed through Paul\\'s awareness:\\n\\n\\x0c\"When your opponent fears you, then\\'s the moment when you give the fear its own\\nrein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man\\nfights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most\\ndangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal\\nmistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them. \"\\nThe crowd in the cavern began to mutter.\\nThey think Paul\\'s toying with Jamis, Jessica thought. They think Paul\\'s\\nbeing needlessly cruel.\\nBut she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of\\nthe spectacle. And she could see the pressure building up in Jamis. The moment\\nwhen it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to\\nJamis . . . or to Paul.\\nJamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the\\nhand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.\\nJessica gasped.\\nBut Paul had been warned by Chani: \"Jamis fights with either hand.\" And the\\ndepth of his training had taken in that trick en passant. \"Keep the mind on the\\nknife and not on the hand that holds it, \" Gurney Halleck had told him time and\\nagain. \"The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either\\nhand.\"\\nAnd Paul had seen Jamis\\' mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a\\nheartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to confuse\\nPaul and hide the knife shift.\\nExcept for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the\\nstaring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor. Shields didn\\'t\\ncount where the body\\'s own movement could be used against it. Paul shifted his\\nown knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis\\'\\nchest was descending--then away to watch the man crumble.\\nJamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face\\ntoward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His dead eyes stared out like\\nbeads of dark glass.\\n\"Killing with the point lacks artistry,\" Idaho had once told Paul, \"but\\ndon\\'t let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself.\"\\nThe troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid\\nJamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently a group of them hurried back\\ninto the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.\\nAnd there was no body on the rock floor.\\nJessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a sea of\\nrobed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.\\nNow is the terrible moment, she thought. He has killed a man in clear\\nsuperiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.\\nShe forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space\\nwhere two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into his stillsuit.\\nJessica stared at her son. Paul\\'s eyes were bright. He breathed heavily,\\npermitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.\\n\"Him against Jamis and not a mark on him,\" one of the men muttered.\\nChani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl\\'s\\nexcitement, the admiration in the elfin face.\\nIt must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thought.\\nShe compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: \"Well-l-l,\\nnow--how does it feel to be a killer?\"\\nPaul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother\\'s cold glare\\nand his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the\\nplace on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.\\nStilgar pressed through to Jessica\\'s side, returning from the cave depths\\nwhere the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled\\n\\n\\x0ctone: \"When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not\\nthink you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.\"\\nJessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar\\'s sank into Paul, doing\\ntheir harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made--it served a purpose\\nnow. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw.\\nAdmiration, yes, and fear . . . and in some--loathing. She looked at Stilgar,\\nsaw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.\\nPaul looked at his mother. \"You know what it was,\" he said.\\nShe heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her\\nglance across the troop, said: \"Paul has never before killed a man with a naked\\nblade.\"\\nStilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.\\n\"I wasn\\'t playing with him,\" Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother,\\nstraightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis\\' blood on the cavern\\nfloor. \"I did not want to kill him.\"\\nJessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he\\ntugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering awareness\\nspread through the troop.\\n\"That\\'s why y\\' asked him to yield,\" Stilgar said. \"I see. Our ways are\\ndifferent, but you\\'ll see the sense in them. I thought we\\'d admitted a scorpion\\ninto our midst.\" He hesitated, then: \"And I shall not call you lad the more.\"\\nA voice from the troop called out: \"Needs a naming, Stil.\"\\nStilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. \"I see strength in you . . . like the\\nstrength beneath a pillar.\" Again he paused, then: \"You shall be known among us\\nas Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We\\nof Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume . . . Usul.\"\\nMurmuring went through the troop: \"Good choice, that . . . strong . . .\\nbring us luck.\" And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in\\nit with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.\\n\"Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?\" Stilgar\\nasked.\\nPaul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment\\nregistered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they\\nwere physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.\\n\"How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?\" Paul\\nasked, remembering the pop-hop of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one\\nhand.\\nA chuckle sounded through the troop.\\n\"We call that one Muad\\'Dib,\" Stilgar said.\\nJessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen\\nwould accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear of her son and for\\nhim.\\nPaul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless\\ntimes in his mind . . . yet . . . there were differences. He could see himself\\nperched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a\\nprofound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.\\nAnd again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green\\nand black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in\\nthe name of their prophet Muad\\'Dib.\\nThat must not happen, he told himself.\\n\"Is that the name you wish, Muad\\'Dib?\" Stilgar asked.\\n\"I am an Atreides,\" Paul whispered, and then louder: \"It\\'s not right that I\\ngive up entirely the name my father gave me. Could I be known among you as Paul-Muad\\'Dib?\"\\n\"You are Paul-Muad\\'Dib,\" Stilgar said.\\nAnd Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.\\nBut he felt that the abyss remained all around him.\\n\\n\\x0cAgain a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man:\\n\"Wisdom with strength . . . Couldn\\'t ask more . . . It\\'s the legend for sure . .\\n. Lisan al-Gaib . . . Lisan al-Gaib . . . \"\\n\"I will tell you a thing about your new name,\" Stilgar said. \"The choice\\npleases us. Muad\\'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad\\'Dib creates his own\\nwater. Muad\\'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad\\'Dib is\\nfruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad\\'Dib we call \\'instructor-of-boys.\\'\\nThat is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad\\'Dib, who is Usul\\namong us. We welcome you.\"\\nStilgar touched Paul\\'s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced\\nPaul and murmured, \"Usul.\"\\nAs Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul,\\nrepeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace\\nthrough the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone; \"Usul . . . Usul .\\n. . Usul.\" Already, he could place some of them by name. And there was Chani who\\npressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.\\nPresently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: \"Now, you are of the\\nIchwan Bedwine, our brother.\" His face hardened, and he spoke with command in\\nhis voice. \"And now, Paul-Muad\\'Dib, tighten up that stillsuit.\" He glanced at\\nChani. \"Chani! Paul-Muad\\'Dib\\'s nose plugs are as poor a fit I\\'ve ever seen! I\\nthought I ordered you to see after him! \"\\n\"I hadn\\'t the makings, Stil,\" she said. \"There\\'s Jamis\\' of course, but--\"\\n\"Enough of that!\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll share one of mine,\" she said. \"I can make do with one until--\"\\n\"You will not,\" Stilgar said. \"I know there are spares among us. Where are\\nthe spares? Are we a troop together or a band of savages?\"\\nHands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar\\nselected four, handed them to Chani. \"Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina.\"\\nA voice lifted from the back of the troop: \"What of the water, Stil? What of\\nthe literjons in their pack?\"\\n\"I know your need, Farok,\" Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.\\n\"Broach one for those that need it,\" Stilgar said. \"Watermaster . . . where\\nis a watermaster? Ah, Shimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed. The\\nnecessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and\\nwill be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees.\"\\n\"What is the repayment at field rates?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"Ten for one,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"But--\"\\n\"It\\'s a wise rule as you\\'ll come to see,\" Stilgar said.\\nA rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned\\nto get the water.\\nStilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. \"As to Jamis,\" he said, \"I\\norder the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan\\nBedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved\\nour fortune by his tahaddi-challenge. I invoke the rite . . . at sunset when the\\ndark shall cover him.\"\\nPaul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the\\nabyss . . . blind time. There was no past occupying the future in his mind . . .\\nexcept . . . except . . . he could still sense the green and black Atreides\\nbanner waving . . . somewhere ahead . . . still see the jihad\\'s bloody swords\\nand fanatic legions.\\nIt will not be, he told himself. I cannot let it be.\\n', 35: '\\nGod created Arrakis to train the faithful.\\n-from \"The Wisdom of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\n\\x0cIn the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as\\npeople moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of\\nhis watchmen.\\nThe great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave\\'s opening. She\\ncould see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her\\nand the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in\\nthe dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would\\ngive her what these Fremen obviously had--the ability to sense even the\\nslightest change in the air\\'s moisture.\\nHow they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened!\\nDeep within the cave, someone began chanting:\\n\"Ima trava okolo!\\nI korenja okolo!\"\\nJessica translated silently: These are ashes! And these are roots! \"\\nThe funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.\\nShe looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the\\nsky. Night was beginning to utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the\\ndunes.\\nYet the heat persisted.\\nHeat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole\\npeople could be trained to be thirsty only at given times.\\nThirst.\\nShe could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks\\n. . . and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her robes\\nseared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs\\nirritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed\\ndown across her face into the suit, recovering her breath\\'s moisture.\\nThe suit itself was a sweatbox.\\n\"Your suit will be more comfortable when you\\'ve adjusted to a lower wafer\\ncontent in your body, \" Stilgar had said.\\nShe knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more\\ncomfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind.\\nNo, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.\\nAnd that was a more subtle and profound matter.\\nShe heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave\\'s\\ndepths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.\\nThere\\'s another thing, Jessica thought. Paul must be cautioned about their\\nwomen. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine,\\nyes, but not as wife.\\nThen she wondered at herself, thinking: Have I been infected with his\\nschemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. I can think of the\\nmarital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet . . . I\\nwas more than concubine.\\n\"Mother.\"\\nPaul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.\\n\"Mother, do you know what they\\'re doing back there?\"\\nJessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. \"I\\nthink so.\"\\n\"Chani showed me . . . because I\\'m supposed to see it and give my . . .\\npermission for the weighing of the water.\"\\nJessica looked at Chani.\\n\"They\\'re recovering Jamis\\' water,\" Chani said, and her thin voice came out\\nnasal past the nose plugs. \"It\\'s the rule. The flesh belongs to the person, but\\nhis water belongs to the tribe . . . except in the combat.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"They say the water\\'s mine,\" Paul said.\\nJessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.\\n\"Combat water belongs to the winner,\" Chani said. \"It\\'s because you have to\\nfight in the open without stillsuits. The winner has to get his water back that\\nhe loses while fighting.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want his water,\" Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of many\\nimages moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the\\ninner eye. He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was\\npositive: he did not want the water distilled out of Jamis\\' flesh.\\n\"It\\'s . . . water,\" Chani said.\\nJessica marveled at the way she said it. \"Water.\" So much meaning in a\\nsimple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica\\'s mind: \"Survival is the\\nability to swim in strange water.\" And Jessica thought: Paul and I, we must find\\nthe currents and patterns in these strange waters . . . if we\\'re to survive.\\n\"You will accept the water,\" Jessica said.\\nShe recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once with\\nLeto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his\\nsupport in a questionable venture--because money maintained power for the\\nAtreides.\\nOn Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.\\nPaul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered--not\\nbecause she ordered it, but because her tone of voice had forced him to re-evaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.\\nPresently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh\\'s O.C. Bible. He\\nsaid: \"From water does all life begin.\"\\nJessica stared at him. Where did he learn that quotation? she asked herself.\\nHe hasn\\'t studied the mysteries.\\n\"Thus it is spoken,\" Chani said. \"Giudichar mantene: It is written in the\\nShah-Nama that water was the first of all things created.\"\\nFor no reason she could explain (and this bothered her more than the\\nsensation), Jessica suddenly shuddered. She turned away to hide her confusion\\nand was just in time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over\\nthe sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.\\n\"It is time!\"\\nThe voice was Stilgar\\'s ringing in the cavern. \"Jamis\\' weapon has been\\nkilled. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained the phases\\nfor the moons that daily wane and--in the end--appear as bent and withered\\ntwigs.\" Stilgar\\'s voice lowered. \"Thus it is with Jamis.\"\\nSilence fell like a blanket on the cavern.\\nJessica saw the gray-shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within\\nthe dark inner reaches. She glanced back at the basin, sensing the coolness.\\n\"The friends of Jamis will approach,\" Stilgar said.\\nMen moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A single\\nglowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave. Its yellow glow picked out\\nan inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.\\nChani took a step away as though pulled by the light.\\nJessica bent close to Paul\\'s ear, speaking in the family code: \"Follow their\\nlead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of\\nJamis.\"\\nIt will be more than that, Paul thought. And he felt a wrenching sensation\\nwithin his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and\\nrender it motionless.\\nChani glided back to Jessica\\'s side, took her hand. \"Come, Sayyadina. We\\nmust sit apart.\"\\nPaul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt\\nabandoned.\\nThe men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Come, Usul.\"\\nHe allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of\\npeople being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a\\nbundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.\\nThe troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with\\nthe movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the\\noverhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at\\nhis neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar\\'s\\nfeet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric.\\n\"The spirit leaves the body\\'s water when the first moon rises,\" Stilgar\\nintoned. \"Thus it is spoken. When we see the first moon rise this night, whom\\nwill it summon?\"\\n\"Jamis,\" the troop responded.\\nStilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of\\nfaces. \"I was a friend of Jamis,\" he said. \"When the hawk plane stooped upon us\\nat Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety.\"\\nHe bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. \"I take this robe as\\na friend of Jamis--leader\\'s right.\" He draped the robe over a shoulder,\\nstraightening.\\nNow, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of\\na stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center,\\nthe bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a folded pack, a\\nparacompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an\\nassortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of\\nbundled feathers . . . and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.\\nSo Jamis played the baliset, Paul thought. The instrument reminded him of\\nGurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory of the future in\\nthe past that some chance-lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the\\nreunions were few and shadowed. They puzzled him. The uncertainty factor touched\\nhim with wonder. Does it mean that something I will do . . . that I may do,\\ncould destroy Gurney . . . or bring him back to life . . . or . . .\\nPaul swallowed, shook his head.\\nAgain, Stilgar bent over the mound.\\n\"For Jamis\\' woman and for the guards,\" he said. The small rocks and the book\\nwere taken into the folds of his robe.\\n\"Leader\\'s right,\" the troop intoned.\\n\"The marker for Jamis\\' coffee service,\" Stilgar said, and he lifted a flat\\ndisc of green metal. \"That it shall be given to Usul in suitable ceremony when\\nwe return to the sietch.\"\\n\"Leader\\'s right,\" the troop intoned.\\nLastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it.\\n\"For the funeral plain,\" he said.\\n\"For the funeral plain,\" the troop responded.\\nAt her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the\\nancient source of the rite, and she thought: The meeting between ignorance and\\nknowledge, between brutality and culture--it begins in the dignity with which we\\ntreat our dead. She looked across at Paul, wondering: Will he see it? Will he\\nknow what to do?\\n\"We are friends of Jamis,\" Stilgar said. \"We are not wailing for our dead\\nlike a pack of garvarg.\"\\nA gray-bearded man to Paul\\'s left stood up. \"I was a friend of Jamis,\" he\\nsaid. He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans. \"When our water went below\\nminim at the siege at Two Birds, Jamis shared.\" The man returned to his place in\\nthe circle.\\nAm I supposed to say I was a friend of Jamis? Paul wondered. Do they expect\\nme to take something from that pile? He saw faces turn toward him, turn away.\\nThey do expect it!\\n\\n\\x0cAnother man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the\\nparacompass. \"I was a friend of Jamis,\" he said. \"When the patrol caught us at\\nBight-of-the-Cliff and I was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could\\nbe saved.\" He returned to his place in the circle.\\nAgain, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them,\\nlowered his eyes. An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: \"Would you bring the\\ndestruction on us?\"\\nHow can I say I was his friend? Paul wondered.\\nAnother figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded face\\ncame into the light, he recognized his mother. She removed a kerchief from the\\nmount. \"I was a friend of Jamis,\" she said. \"When the spirit of spirits within\\nhim saw the needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son.\" She\\nreturned to her place.\\nAnd Paul recalled the scorn in his mother\\'s voice as she had confronted him\\nafter the fight. \"How does it f eel to be a killer?\"\\nAgain, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in the\\ntroop. A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on \"The Cult of the\\nDead\" flickered through Paul\\'s mind. He knew what he had to do.\\nSlowly, Paul got to his feet.\\nA sigh passed around the circle.\\nPaul felt the diminishment of his self as he advanced into the center of the\\ncircle. It was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here. He\\nbent over the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged\\nsoftly as it struck against something in the pile.\\n\"I was a friend of Jamis,\" Paul whispered.\\nHe felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice. \"Jamis\\ntaught me . . . that . . . when you kill . . . you pay for it. I wish I\\'d known\\nJamis better.\"\\nBlindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock\\nfloor.\\nA voice hissed: \"He sheds tears!\"\\nIt was taken up around the ring: \"Usul gives moisture to the dead!\"\\nHe felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.\\nJessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what\\nterrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears. She focused on the\\nwords: \"He gives moisture to the dead.\" It was a gift to the shadow world-tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.\\nNothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate\\nvalue of water. Not the water-sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not\\nstillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a substance more\\nprecious than all others--it was life itself and entwined all around with\\nsymbolism and ritual.\\nWater.\\n\"I touched his cheek,\" someone whispered. \"I felt the gift.\"\\nAt first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul. He clutched the\\ncold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm. Then he saw the\\nfaces beyond the groping hands--the eyes wide and wondering.\\nPresently, the hands withdrew. The funeral ceremony resumed. But now there\\nwas a subtle space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop honored him by a\\nrespectful isolation. The ceremony ended with a low chant:\\n\"Full moon calls thee-Shai-hulud shall thou see;\\nRed the night, dusky sky,\\nBloody death didst thou die.\\nWe pray to a moon: she is round-Luck with us will then abound,\\n\\n\\x0cWhat we seek for shall be found\\nIn the land of solid ground.\"\\nA bulging sack remained at Stilgar\\'s feet. He crouched, placed his palms\\nagainst it. Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul\\nrecognized Chani\\'s face in the hood shadow.\\n\"Jamis carried thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds\\ndrachms of the tribe\\'s water,\" Chani said. \"I bless it now in the presence of a\\nSayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water, fillissin-follasy of Paul-Muad\\'Dib!\\nKivi a-kavi, never the more, nakalas! Nakelas! to be measured and counted,\\nukair-an! by the heartbeats jan-jan-jan of our friend . . . Jamis.\"\\nIn an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, stared at Paul. Presently\\nshe said: \"Where I am flame be thou the coals. Where I am dew be thou the\\nwater.\"\\n\"Bi-lal kaifa,\" intoned the troop.\\n\"To Paul-Muad\\'Dib goes this portion,\" Chani said. \"May he guard it for the\\ntribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with it in time\\nof need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe.\"\\n\"Bi-lal kaifa,\" intoned the troop.\\nI must accept that water, Paul thought. Slowly, he arose, made his way to\\nChani\\'s side. Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently\\nfrom his hand.\\n\"Kneel,\" Chani said.\\nPaul knelt.\\nShe guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient\\nsurface. \"With this water the tribe entrusts thee,\" she said. \"Jamis is gone\\nfrom it. Take it in peace.\" She stood, pulling Paul up with her.\\nStilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in one\\npalm. Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the light of the\\nglowglobe reflected off them.\\nChani took the largest ring, held it on a finger. \"Thirty liters,\" she said.\\nOne by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them. \"Two\\nliters; one liter; seven watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of\\nthree-thirty-seconds drachms. In all--thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.\"\\nShe held them up on her finger for Paul to see.\\n\"Do you accept them?\" Stilgar asked.\\nPaul swallowed, nodded. \"Yes.\"\\n\"Later,\" Chani said, \"I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they\\nwon\\'t rattle and give you away when you need silence.\" She extended her hand.\\n\"Will you . . . hold them for me?\" Paul asked.\\nChani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.\\nHe smiled, said, \"Paul-Muad\\'Dib who is Usul does not yet know our ways,\\nChani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it\\'s time to show him the\\nmanner of carrying them.\"\\nShe nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the\\nrings onto it with an intricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then stuffed\\nthem into the sash beneath her robe.\\nI missed something there, Paul thought. He sensed the feeling of humor\\naround him, something bantering in it, and his mind linked up a prescient\\nmemory: watercounters offered to a woman--courtship ritual.\\n\"Watermasters,\" Stilgar said.\\nThe troop arose in a hissing of robes. Two men stepped out, lifted the\\nwaterbag. Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the depths\\nof the cave.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over rock\\nwalls, the way the shadows danced, and he felt the troop\\'s lift of spirits\\ncontained in a hushed air of expectancy.\\nJessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around by\\njostling bodies, suppressed a moment of panic. She had recognized fragments of\\nthe ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani-jib in the words, and\\nshe knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple\\nmoments.\\nJan-jan-jan, she thought. Go-go-go.\\nIt was like a child\\'s game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.\\nStilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall. He pressed an outcropping and the\\nwall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack. He led the\\nway through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air\\nacross Paul when he passed it.\\nPaul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. \"That air felt\\ndamp,\" he said.\\n\"Sh-h-h-h,\" she whispered.\\nBut a man behind them said: \"Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight. Jamis\\'\\nway of telling us he\\'s satisfied.\"\\nJessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind. She saw how\\nthe Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the\\nair as she came opposite it.\\nWindtrap! she thought. They\\'ve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface\\nto funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from\\nit.\\nThey passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the\\ndoor closed behind them. The draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of\\nmoisture clearly perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.\\nAt the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgar\\'s hands dropped below the\\nlevel of the heads in front of Paul. Presently he felt steps beneath his feet,\\ncurving down to the left. Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a\\nwinding movement of people spiraling down the steps.\\nJessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of\\nsilence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.\\nThe steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light of\\nthe glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling.\\nPaul felt Chani\\'s hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill\\nair, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of\\nwater.\\nI have seen this place in a dream, he thought.\\nThe thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him on\\nthis path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his\\nname. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror. Wild\\nlegions would charge into battle screaming their war cry: \"Muad\\'Dib!\"\\nIt must not be, he thought. I cannot let it happen.\\nBut he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own\\nterrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut.\\nIt was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this instant, the thing would\\ngo on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less than the deaths of\\nall the troop gathered here and now--himself and his mother included--could stop\\nthe thing.\\nPaul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed him\\nforward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the barrier in the\\nglow of Stilgar\\'s globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water. It\\nstretched away into shadows--deep and black--the far wall only faintly visible,\\nperhaps a hundred meters away.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in\\nthe presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its deepness,\\nand resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.\\nA splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen,\\nsaw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their\\nload into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a round gray eye above the\\npool\\'s rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it, saw\\nthe pointer stop at thirty-three liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.\\nSuperb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought. And she noted that\\nthe walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water\\'s\\npassage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a\\nprofound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.\\nJessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar\\'s side. Way was made for\\nher with casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul\\'s eyes, but the\\nmystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts.\\nStilgar looked at her. \"There were those among us in need of water,\" he\\nsaid, \"yet they would come here and not touch this water. Do you know that?\"\\n\"I believe it,\" she said.\\nHe looked at the pool. \"We have more than thirty-eight million decaliters\\nhere,\" he said. \"Walled off from the little makers, hidden and preserved.\"\\n\"A treasure trove,\" she said.\\nStilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes. \"It is greater than\\ntreasure. We have thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them all.\" He\\ncocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow-shadowed glow across face\\nand beard. \"Hear that?\"\\nThey listened.\\nThe dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with\\nits presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of\\nlistening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.\\nTo Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing\\nthrough him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision,\\nbut felt powerless to move.\\n\"It has been calculated with precision,\" Stilgar whispered. \"We know to\\nwithin a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change\\nthe face of Arrakis.\"\\nA hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: \"Bi-lal kaifa.\"\\n\"We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings,\" Stilgar said, his voice\\ngrowing stronger. \"We will tie the water into the soil with trees and\\nundergrowth.\"\\n\"Bi-lal kaifa,\" intoned the troop.\\n\"Each year the polar ice retreats,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"Bi-lal kaifa,\" they chanted.\\n\"We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis--with melting lenses at the poles,\\nwith lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the maker and\\nhis spice.\"\\n\"Bi-lal kaifa.\"\\n\"And no man ever again shall want for water. It shall be his for dipping\\nfrom well or pond or lake or canal. It shall run down through the qanats to feed\\nour plants. It shall be there for any man to take. It shall be his for holding\\nout his hand.\"\\n\"Bi-lal kaifa.\"\\nJessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively\\nawed response. They\\'re in league with the future, she thought. They have their\\nmountain to climb. This is the scientist\\'s dream . . . and these simple people,\\nthese peasants, are filled with it.\\nHer thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor\\'s planetary ecologist, the\\nman who had gone native--and she wondered at him. This was a dream to capture\\n\\n\\x0cmen\\'s souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it. This was a\\ndream for which men would die willingly. It was another of the essential\\ningredients that she felt her son needed; people with a goal. Such people would\\nbe easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword\\nto win back Paul\\'s place for him.\\n\"We leave now,\" Stilgar said, \"and wait for the first moon\\'s rising. When\\nJamis is safely on his way, we will go home.\"\\nWhispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along\\nthe water barrier and up the stairs.\\nAnd Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him,\\nthat he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth.\\nHe knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a fragment of prescient\\ndream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place were being filled in now that\\nhe had not seen. He felt a new sense of wonder at the limits of his gift. It was\\nas though he rode within the wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on\\na crest--and all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then\\nhiding what they bore on their surface.\\nThrough it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence and\\nthe slaughter. It was like a promontory above the surf.\\nThe troop filed through the last door into the main cavern. The door was\\nsealed. Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern openings,\\nrevealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert.\\nJessica moved to the dry lip of the cavern\\'s edge, looked up at the stars.\\nThey were sharp and near. She felt the stirring of the troop around her, heard\\nthe sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her, and Paul\\'s voice\\nhumming the pitch. There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like.\\nChani\\'s voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: \"Tell me about the\\nwaters of your birthworld, Paul Muad\\'Dib.\"\\nAnd Paul: \"Another time, Chani. I promise.\"\\nSuch sadness.\\n\"It\\'s a good baliset,\" Chani said.\\n\"Very good,\" Paul said. \"Do you think Jamis\\'ll mind my using it?\"\\nHe speaks of the dead in the present tense, Jessica thought. The\\nimplications disturbed her.\\nA man\\'s voice intruded: \"He liked music betimes, Jamis did.\"\\n\"Then sing me one of your songs,\" Chani pleaded.\\nSuch feminine allure in that girl-child\\'s voice, Jessica thought.

Visiting observers from the Imperial Court-a Count and Lady Fenring--were on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime for\\nthe event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden\\nbox above the triangular arena.\\nIn honor of the na-Baron\\'s nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and\\nsubjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime. The\\nold Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from labors, and effort had\\nbeen spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of gaiety: banners\\nflew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the walls along Court Way.\\nBut off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps,\\nthe scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the\\nfurtive scurrying of the people.\\nIn the Baron\\'s blue-walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the Count\\nand his lady saw the price being paid--guards everywhere and weapons with that\\nspecial sheen that told a trained eye they were in regular use. There were\\ncheckpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep. The\\nservants revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of\\ntheir shoulders . . . in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.\\n\"The pressure\\'s on,\" the Count hummed to his lady in their secret language.\\n\"The Baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of\\nthe Duke Leto.\"\\n\"Sometime I must recount for you the legend of the phoenix,\" she said.\\nThey were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family\\ngames. It was not a large hall--perhaps forty meters long and half that in\\nwidth--but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper,\\nand the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater\\nspace.\\n\"Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron,\" the Count said.\\nThe Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddling-glide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor-hung weight. His jowls\\nbobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe.\\nRings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into\\nthe robe.\\nAt the Baron\\'s elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in close\\nringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes. He wore a tight-fitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom.\\nSoft-soled slippers covered his small feet.\\n\\n\\x0cLady Fenring, noting the young man\\'s poise and the sure flow of muscles\\nbeneath the tunic thought: Here\\'s one who won\\'t let himself go to fat.\\nThe Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd-Rautha\\'s arm in a possessive\\ngrip, said, \"My nephew, the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.\" And, turning his\\nbaby-fat face toward Feyd-Rautha, he said, \"The Count and Lady Fenring of whom\\nI\\'ve spoken.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the\\nLady Fenring. She was golden-haired and willowy, her perfection of figure\\nclothed in a flowing gown of ecru--simple fitness of form without ornament.\\nGray-green eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene Gesserit serene repose\\nabout her that the young man found subtly disturbing.\\n\"Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m,\" said the Count. He studied Feyd-Rautha. \"The, hm-mm-m, precise young man, ah, my . . . hm-m-m-m . . . dear?\" The Count glanced at\\nthe Baron. \"My dear Baron, you say you\\'ve spoken of us to this precise young\\nman? What did you say?\"\\n\"I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you. Count\\nFenring,\" the Baron said. And he thought: Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the\\nmanners of a rabbit--this is the most dangerous kind.\\n\"Of course!\" said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.\\nFeyd-Rautha found the man\\'s actions and words almost insulting. They stopped\\njust short of something overt that would require notice. The young man focused\\nhis attention on the Count: a small man, weak-looking. The face was weaselish\\nwith overlarge dark eyes. There was gray at the temples. And his movements--he\\nmoved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way. It was\\ndifficult to follow.\\n\"Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you come upon such, mm-m-m, preciseness so\\nrarely,\" the Count said, addressing the Baron\\'s shoulder. \"I . . . ah,\\ncongratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the light of\\nthe hm-m-m elder, one might say.\"\\n\"You are too kind,\" the Baron said. He bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted that his\\nuncle\\'s eyes did not agree with the courtesy.\\n\"When you\\'re mm-m-m ironic, that ah-h-h suggests you\\'re hm-m-m-m thinking\\ndeep thoughts,\" the Count said.\\nThere he goes again, Feyd-Rautha thought. It sounds like he\\'s being\\ninsulting, but there\\'s nothing you can call out for satisfaction.\\nListening to the man gave Feyd-Rautha the feeling his head was being pushed\\nthrough mush . . . um-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m! Feyd-Rautha turned his attention back\\nto the Lady Fenring.\\n\"We\\'re ah-h-h taking up too much of this young man\\'s time,\" she said. \"I\\nunderstand he\\'s to appear in the arena today.\"\\nBy the houris of the Imperial hareem, she\\'s a lovely one! Feyd-Rautha\\nthought. He said: \"I shall make a kill for you this day, my Lady. I shall make\\nthe dedication in the arena, with your permission.\"\\nShe returned his stare serenely, but her voice carried whiplash as she said:\\n\"You do not have my permission.\"\\n\"Feyd!\" the Baron said. And he thought: That imp! Does he want this deadly\\nCount to call him out?\\nBut the Count only smiled and said: \"Hm-m-m-m-um-m-m.\"\\n\"You really must be getting ready for the arena, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"You\\nmust be rested and not take any foolish risks.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha bowed, his face dark with resentment. \"I\\'m sure everything will\\nbe as you wish, Uncle.\" He nodded to Count Fenring. \"Sir.\" To the lady: \"My\\nLady.\" And he turned, strode out of the hall, barely glancing at the knot of\\nFamilies Minor near the double doors.\\n\"He\\'s so young,\" the Baron sighed.\\n\"Um-m-m-m-ah indeed hmmm,\" the Count said.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd the Lady Fenring thought: Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother\\nmeant? Is that a bloodline we must preserve?\\n\"We\\'ve more than an hour before going to the arena,\" the Baron sad. \"Perhaps\\nwe could have our little talk now, Count Fenring.\" He tipped his gross head to\\nthe right. \"There\\'s a considerable amount of progress to be discussed.\"\\nAnd the Baron thought; Let us see now how the Emperors errand boy gets\\nacross whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to speak it\\nright out.\\nThe Count spoke to his lady: \"Um-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you mm-m will ah-h-h\\nexcuse us, my dear?\"\\n\"Each day, some time each hour, brings change,\" she said. \"Mm-m-m-m.\" And\\nshe smiled sweetly at the Baron before turning away. Her long skirts swished and\\nshe walked with a straight-backed regal stride toward the double doors at the\\nend of the hall.\\nThe Baron noted how all conversation among the Houses Minor there stopped at\\nher approach, how the eyes followed her. Bene Gesserit! the Baron thought. The\\nuniverse would be better rid of them all!\\n\"There\\'s a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our\\nleft,\" the Baron said. \"We can talk there without fear of being overheard.\" He\\nled the way with his waddling gait into the sound-deadening field, feeling the\\nnoises of the keep become dull and distant.\\nThe Count moved up beside the Baron, and they turned, facing the wall so\\ntheir lips could not be read.\\n\"We\\'re not satisfied with the way you ordered the Sardaukar off Arrakis,\"\\nthe Count said.\\nStraight talk! the Baron thought.\\n\"The Sardaukar could not stay longer without risking that others would find\\nout how the Emperor helped me,\" the Baron said.\\n\"But your nephew Rabban does not appear to be pressing strongly enough\\ntoward a solution of the Fremen problem.\"\\n\"What does the Emperor wish?\" the Baron asked. \"There cannot be more than a\\nhandful of Fremen left on Arrakis. The southern desert is uninhabitable. The\\nnorthern desert is swept regularly by our patrols.\"\\n\"Who says the southern desert is uninhabitable?\"\\n\"Your own planetologist said it, my dear Count.\"\\n\"But Doctor Kynes is dead.\"\\n\"Ah, yes . . . unfortunate, that.\"\\n\"We\\'ve word from an overflight across the southern reaches,\" the Count said.\\n\"There\\'s evidence of plant life.\"\\n\"Has the Guild then agreed to a watch from space?\"\\n\"You know better than that, Baron. The Emperor cannot legally post a watch\\non Arrakis.\"\\n\"And I cannot afford it,\" the Baron said. \"Who made this overflight?\"\\n\"A . . . smuggler.\"\\n\"Someone has lied to you, Count,\" the Baron said. \"Smugglers cannot\\nnavigate, the southern reaches any better than can Rabban\\'s men. Storms, sand static, and all that, you know. Navigation markers are knocked out faster than\\nthey can be installed.\"\\n\"We\\'ll discuss various types of static another time,\" the Count said.\\nAh-h-h-h, the Baron thought. \"Have you found some mistake in my accounting\\nthen?\" he demanded.\\n\"When you imagine mistakes there can be no self-defense,\" the Count said.\\nHe\\'s deliberately trying to arouse my anger, the Baron thought. He took two\\ndeep breaths to calm himself. He could smell his own sweat, and the harness of\\nthe suspensors beneath his robe felt suddenly itchy and galling.\\n\"The Emperor cannot be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the\\nboy,\" the Baron said. \"They fled into the desert. There was a storm.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Yes, there were so many convenient accidents,\" the Count agreed\\n\"I do not like your tone, Count,\" the Baron said.\\n\"Anger is one thing, violence another,\" the Count said. \"Let me caution you:\\nShould an unfortunate accident occur to me here the Great Houses all would learn\\nwhat you did on Arrakis. They\\'ve long suspected how you do business.\"\\n\"The only recent business I can recall,\" the Baron said, \"was transportation\\nof several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis.\"\\n\"You think you could hold that over the Emperor\\'s head?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t think of it!\"\\nThe Count smiled. \"Sardaukar commanders could be found who\\'d confess they\\nacted without orders because they wanted a battle with your Fremen scum.\"\\n\"Many might doubt such a confession,\" the Baron said, but the threat\\nstaggered him. Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined? he wondered.\\n\"The Emperor does wish to audit your books,\" the Count said.\\n\"Any time.\"\\n\"You . . . ah . . . have no objections?\"\\n\"None. My CHOAM Company directorship will bear the closest scrutiny.\" And he\\nthought: Let him bring a false accusation against me and have it exposed. I\\nshall stand there, Promethean, saying: \"Behold me, I am wronged. \" Then let him\\nbring any other accusation against me, even a true one. The Great Houses will\\nnot believe a second attack from an accuser once proved wrong.\\n\"No doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny,\" the Count muttered.\\n\"Why is the Emperor so interested in exterminating the Fremen?\" the Baron\\nasked.\\n\"You wish the subject to be changed, eh?\" The Count shrugged. \"It is the\\nSardaukar who wish it, not the Emperor. They needed practice in killing . . .\\nand they hate to see a task left undone.\"\\nDoes he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by\\nbloodthirsty killers? the Baron wondered.\\n\"A certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business,\" the Baron\\nsaid, \"but a line has to be drawn somewhere. Someone must be left to work the\\nspice.\"\\nThe Count emitted a short, barking laugh. \"You think you can harness the\\nFremen?\"\\n\"There never were enough of them for that,\" the Baron said. \"But the killing\\nhas made the rest of my population uneasy. It\\'s reaching the point where I\\'m\\nconsidering another solution to the Arrakeen problem, my dear Fenring. And I\\nmust confess the Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h?\"\\n\"You see, Count, I have the Emperor\\'s prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to\\ninspire me.\"\\nThe Count stared at him with glittering intensity. \"What possible connection\\nis there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?\"\\nThe Baron felt the alertness in Fenring\\'s eyes, said: \"No connection yet.\"\\n\"Yet?\"\\n\"You must admit it\\'d be a way to develop a substantial work force on\\nArrakis--use the place as a prison planet.\"\\n\"You anticipate an increase in prisoners?\"\\n\"There has been unrest,\" the Baron admitted. \"I\\'ve had to squeeze rather\\nseverely, Fenring. After all, you know the price I paid that damnable Guild to\\ntransport our mutual force to Arrakis. That money has to come from somewhere.\"\\n\"I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor\\'s\\npermission, Baron.\"\\n\"Of course not,\" the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in\\nFenring\\'s voice.\\n\"Another matter,\" the Count said. \"We learn that Duke Leto\\'s Mentat, Thufir\\nHawat, is not dead but in your employ.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"I could not bring myself to waste him,\" the Baron said.\\n\"You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead.\"\\n\"Only a white lie, my dear Count. I hadn\\'t the stomach for a long argument\\nwith the man.\"\\n\"Was Hawat the real traitor?\"\\n\"Oh, goodness, no! It was the false doctor.\" The Baron wiped at perspiration\\non his neck. \"You must understand, Fenring, I was without a Mentat. You know\\nthat. I\\'ve never been without a Mentat. It was most unsettling.\"\\n\"How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?\"\\n\"His Duke was dead.\" The Baron forced a smile. \"There\\'s nothing to fear from\\nHawat, my dear Count. The Mentat\\'s flesh has been impregnated with a latent\\npoison. We administer an antidote in his meals. Without the antidote, the poison\\nis triggered--he\\'d die in a few days.\"\\n\"Withdraw the antidote,\" the Count said.\\n\"But he\\'s useful!\"\\n\"And he knows too many things no living man should know.\"\\n\"You said the Emperor doesn\\'t fear exposure.\"\\n\"Don\\'t play games with me, Baron!\"\\n\"When I see such an order above the Imperial seal I\\'ll obey it,\" the Baron\\nsaid. \"But I\\'ll not submit to your whim.\"\\n\"You think it whim?\"\\n\"What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. I rid\\nhim of the troublesome Duke.\"\\n\"With the help of a few Sardaukar.\"\\n\"Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising\\nuniforms to hide his hand in this matter?\"\\n\"He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly\\ndifferent emphasis.\"\\nThe Baron studied Fenring, noting the stiffness of jaw muscles, the careful\\ncontrol. \"Ah-h-h, now,\" the Baron said. \"I hope the Emperor doesn\\'t believe he\\ncan move against me in total secrecy.\"\\n\"He hopes it won\\'t become necessary.\"\\n\"The Emperor cannot believe I threaten him!\" The Baron permitted anger and\\ngrief to edge his voice, thinking: Let him wrong me in that! I could place\\nmyself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I\\'d been wronged.\\nThe Count\\'s voice went dry and remote as he said: \"The Emperor believes what\\nhis senses tell him.\"\\n\"Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council?\"\\nAnd the Baron held his breath with the hope of it.\\n\"The Emperor need dare nothing.\"\\nThe Baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression. It could\\nhappen in my lifetime! he thought. Emperor! Let him wrong me! Then--the bribes\\nand coercion, the rallying of the Great Houses: they\\'d flock to my banner like\\npeasants running for shelter. The thing they fear above all else is the\\nEmperor\\'s Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time.\\n\"It\\'s the Emperor\\'s sincere hope he\\'ll never have to charge you with\\ntreason,\" the Count said.\\nThe Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only\\nthe expression of hurt, but he managed. \"I\\'ve been a most loyal subject. These\\nwords hurt me beyond my capacity to express.\"\\n\"Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m,\" said the Count.\\nThe Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding. Presently he said, \"It\\'s time\\nto go to the arena.\"\\n\"Indeed,\" said the Count.\\nThey moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward the\\nclumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall. A bell began a slow tolling\\nsomewhere in the keep--twenty-minute warning for the arena gathering.\\n\\n\\x0c\"The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them,\" the Count said, nodding toward\\nthe people they approached.\\nDouble meaning . . . double meaning, the Baron thought.\\nHe looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hall--the mounted\\nbull\\'s head and the oil painting of the Old Duke Atreides, the late Duke Leto\\'s\\nfather. They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered\\nwhat thoughts these talismans had inspired in the Duke Leto as they hung in the\\nhalls of Caladan and then on Arrakis--the bravura father and the head of the\\nbull that had killed him.\\n\"Mankind has ah only one mm-m-m science,\" the Count said as they picked up\\ntheir parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room--a\\nnarrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.\\n\"And what science is that?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"It\\'s the um-m-m-ah-h science of ah-h-h discontent,\" the Count said.\\nThe Houses Minor behind them, sheep-faced and responsive, laughed with just\\nthe right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of discord as it\\ncollided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open\\nthe outer doors, revealing the line of ground cars, their guidon pennants\\nwhipping in a breeze.\\nThe Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, \"I hope\\nyou\\'ll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today, Count\\nFenring.\"\\n\"I ah-h-h am filled um-m-m only with a hm-m-m sense of anticipation, yes,\"\\nthe Count said. \"Always in the ah-h-h process verbal, one um-m-m ah-h-h must\\nconsider the ah-h-h office of origin.\"\\nThe Baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first\\nstep down from the exit. Process verbal! That was a report of a crime against\\nthe Imperium!\\nBut the Count chuckled to make it seem a joke, and patted the Baron\\'s arm.\\nAll the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored\\ncushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him, wondering\\nwhy the Emperor\\'s errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular\\nkind of joke in front of the Houses Minor. It was obvious that Fenring seldom\\ndid anything he felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or\\nheld himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.\\nThey were seated in the golden box above the triangular arena--horns\\nblaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and\\nwaving pennants--when the answer came to the Baron.\\n\"My dear Baron,\" the Count said, leaning close to his ear, \"you know, don\\'t\\nyou, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir?\"\\nThe Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence\\nproduced by his own shock. He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the Count\\'s lady\\ncome through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box.\\n\"That\\'s really why I\\'m here today,\" the Count said. \"The Emperor wishes me\\nto report on whether you\\'ve chosen a worthy successor. There\\'s nothing like the\\narena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?\"\\n\"The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!\" the Baron grated.\\n\"We shall see,\" Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady. She sat\\ndown, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath\\nthem where Feyd-Rautha was emerging in giles and tights--the black glove and the\\nlong knife in his right hand, the white glove and the short knife in his left\\nhand.\\n\"White for poison, black for purity,\" the Lady Fenring said. \"A curious\\ncustom, isn\\'t it, my love?\"\\n\"Um-m-m-m,\" the Count said.\\nThe greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd-Rautha paused\\nto accept it, looking up and scanning the faces--seeing his cousines and\\n\\n\\x0ccousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-freyn relations. They were so\\nmany pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and\\nbanners.\\nIt came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just\\nas avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was not a doubt\\nof the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the form of danger\\nwithout its substance--yet . . .\\nFeyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of the\\narena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand (white, the\\nsign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long blade in the black-gloved hand--the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn this\\nday into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade.\\nThe adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to sense\\nthe skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded.\\nThis moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd-Rautha dragged it out with\\nthe sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and distracters, checking\\ntheir equipment with a measuring stare--gyves in place with their prickles sharp\\nand glistening, the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers.\\nFeyd-Rautha signaled the musicians.\\nThe slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha led\\nhis troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle\\'s box. He\\ncaught the ceremonial key as it was thrown.\\nThe music stopped.\\nInto the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and\\nshouted. \"I dedicate this truth to . . . \" And he paused, knowing his uncle\\nwould think: The young fool\\'s going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and\\ncause a ruckus!\\n\" . . . to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!\" Feyd-Rautha\\nshouted.\\nAnd he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.\\nThe music resumed at the quick-march, and Feyd-Rautha led his men scampering\\nback across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the\\nproper identification band. Feyd-Rautha prided himself that he never used the\\npru-door and seldom needed distracters. But it was good to know they were\\navailable this day--special plans sometimes involved special dangers.\\nAgain, silence settled over the arena.\\nFeyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the\\ngladiator would emerge.\\nThe special gladiator.\\nThe plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct, Feyd-Rautha thought. The slave would not be drugged--that was the danger. Instead, a\\nkey word had been drummed into the man\\'s unconscious to immobilize his muscles\\nat a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital word in his mind, mouthing\\nit without sound: \"Scum!\" To the audience, it would appear that an un-drugged\\nslave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na-Baron. And all the\\ncarefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster.\\nA low humming arose from the red door\\'s servomotors as they were armed for\\nopening.\\nFeyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was the\\ncritical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye\\nmuch it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug\\nto come out kill-ready in fighting stance--but you had to watch how they hefted\\nthe knife, which way they turned in defense, whether they were actually aware of\\nthe audience in the stands. The way a slave cocked his head could give the most\\nvital clue to counter and feint.\\nThe red door slammed open.\\n\\n\\x0cOut charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes.\\nHis skin was carrot-colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but Feyd-Rautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards and the red belt\\nof a semishield--the belt\\'s arrow pointing left to indicate the slave\\'s left\\nside was shielded. He held his knife sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward in\\nthe stance of a trained fighter. Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his\\nshielded side toward Feyd-Rautha and the group at the pru-door.\\n\"I like not the look of this one, \"said one of Feyd-Rautha\\'s barb-men. \"Are\\nyou sure he\\'s drugged, m\\'Lord?\"\\n\"He has the color,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\\n\"Yet he stands like a fighter,\" said another helper.\\nFeyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave.\\n\"What has he done to his arm?\" asked one of the distracters.\\nFeyd-Rautha\\'s attention went to a bloody scratch on the man\\'s left forearm,\\nfollowed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in blood on\\nthe left hip of the green leotards--a wet shape there: the formalized outline of\\na hawk.\\nHawk!\\nFeyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him\\nwith uncommon alertness.\\nIt\\'s one of Duke Leto\\'s fighting men we took on Arrakis! Feyd-Rautha\\nthought. No simple gladiator this! A chill ran through him, and he wondered if\\nHawat had another plan for this arena--a feint within a feint within a feint.\\nAnd only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame!\\nFeyd-Rautha\\'s chief handler spoke at his ear: \"I like not the look on that\\none, m\\'Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him.\"\\n\"I\\'ll set my own barbs,\" Feyd-Rautha said. He took a pair of the long,\\nhooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance. These barbs,\\ntoo, were supposed to be drugged--but not this time, and the chief handler might\\ndie because of that. But it was all part of the plan.\\n\"You\\'ll come out of this a hero,\" Hawat had said. \"Killed your gladiator man\\nto man and in spite of treachery. The slavemaster will be executed and your man\\nwill step into his spot.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the\\nmoment, studying the slave. Already, he knew, the experts in the stands above\\nhim were aware that something was wrong. The gladiator had the correct skin\\ncolor for a drugged man, but he stood his ground and did not tremble. The\\naficionados would be whispering among themselves now: \"See how he stands. He\\nshould be agitated--attacking or retreating. See how he conserves his strength,\\nhow he waits. He should not wait.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha felt his own excitement kindle. Let there be treachery in\\nHawat\\'s mind, he thought. I can handle this slave. And it\\'s my long knife that\\ncarries the poison this time, not the short one. Even Hawat doesn\\'t know that.\\n\"Hai, Harkonnen!\" the slave called. \"Are you prepared to die?\"\\nDeathly stillness gripped the arena. Slaves did not issue the challenge!\\nNow, Feyd-Rautha had a clear view of the gladiator\\'s eyes, saw the cold\\nferocity of despair in them. He marked the way the man stood, loose and ready,\\nmuscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried Hawat\\'s message to\\nthis one: \"You\\'ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron.\" That much of the\\nscheme was as they\\'d planned it, then.\\nA tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha\\'s mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing\\nsuccess for his plans in the way the gladiator stood.\\n\"Hai! Hai!\" the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps.\\nNo one in the galleries can mistake it now, Feyd-Rautha thought.\\nThis slave should have been partly crippled by drug-induced terror. Every\\nmovement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope for\\nhim--he could not win. He should have been filled with the stories of the\\n\\n\\x0cpoisons the na-Baron chose for the blade in his white-gloved hand. The na-Baron\\nnever gave quick death; he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons, could stand\\nin the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing victim. There\\nwas fear in the slave, yes--but not terror.\\nFeyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting.\\nThe gladiator pounced.\\nHis feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd-Rautha had ever\\nseen. A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the tendons\\nof the na-Baron\\'s left leg.\\nFeyd-Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slave\\'s right\\nforearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not withdraw\\nthem without ripping tendons.\\nA concerted gasp lifted from the galleries.\\nThe sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation.\\nHe knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the\\nFenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court, beside him. There could be no\\ninterference with this fight. The forms must be observed in front of witnesses.\\nAnd the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only one way--threat to\\nhimself.\\nThe slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his\\narm with the pennant. \"I do not feel your needle!\" he shouted. Again he crept\\nforward, knife ready, left side presented, his body bent backward to give it the\\ngreatest surface of protection from the half-shield.\\nThat action, too, didn\\'t escape the galleries. Sharp cries came from the\\nfamily boxes. Feyd-Rautha\\'s handlers were calling out to ask if he needed them.\\nHe waved them back to the pru-door.\\nI\\'ll give them a show such as they\\'ve never had before, Feyd-Rautha thought.\\nNo tame killing where they can sit back and admire the style. This\\'ll be\\nsomething to take them by the guts and twist them. When I\\'m Baron they\\'ll\\nremember this day and won\\'t be a one of them can escape fear of me because of\\nthis day.\\nFeyd-Rautha gave ground slowly before the gladiator\\'s crablike advance.\\nArena sand grated underfoot. He heard the slave\\'s panting, smelled his own sweat\\nand a faint odor of blood on the air.\\nSteadily, the na-Baron moved backward, turning to the right, his second barb\\nready. The slave danced sideways. Feyd-Rautha appeared to stumble, heard the\\nscream from the galleries.\\nAgain, the slave pounced.\\nGods, what a fighting man! Feyd-Rautha thought as he leaped aside. Only\\nyouth\\'s quickness saved him, but he left the second barb buried in the deltoid\\nmuscle of the slave\\'s right arm.\\nShrill cheers rained from the galleries.\\nThey cheer me now, Feyd-Rautha thought. He heard the wildness in the voices\\njust as Hawat had said he would. They\\'d never cheered a family fighter that way\\nbefore. And he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing Hawat had told him:\\n\"It\\'s easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.\"\\nSwiftly, Feyd-Rautha retreated to the center of the arena where all could\\nsee clearly. He drew his long blade, crouched and waited for the advancing\\nslave.\\nThe man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm, then\\nsped in pursuit.\\nLet the family see me do this thing, Feyd-Rautha thought. I am their enemy:\\nlet them think of me as they see me now.\\nHe drew his short blade.\\n\"I do not fear you, Harkonnen swine,\" the gladiator said. \"Your tortures\\ncannot hurt a dead man. I can be dead on my own blade before a handler lays\\nfinger to my flesh. And I\\'ll have you dead beside me!\"\\n\\n\\x0cFeyd-Rautha grinned, offered now the long blade, the one with the poison.\\n\"Try this one,\" he said, and feinted with the short blade in his other hand.\\nThe slave shifted knife hands, turned inside both parry and feint to grapple\\nthe na-Baron\\'s short blade--the one in the white gloved hand that tradition said\\nshould carry the poison.\\n\"You will die, Harkonnen,\" the gladiator gasped.\\nThey struggled sideways across the sand. Where Feyd-Rautha\\'s shield met the\\nslave\\'s halfshield, a blue glow marked the contact. The air around them filled\\nwith ozone from the field.\\n\"Die on your own poison!\" the slave grated.\\nHe began forcing the white-gloved hand inward, turning the blade he thought\\ncarried the poison.\\nLet them see this! Feyd-Rautha thought. He brought down the long blade, felt\\nit clang uselessly against the barbed shaft lashed to the slave\\'s arm.\\nFeyd-Rautha felt a moment of desperation. He had not thought the barbed\\nshafts would be an advantage for the slave. But they gave the man another\\nshield. And the strength of this gladiator! The short blade was being forced\\ninward inexorably, and Feyd-Rautha focused on the fact that a man could also die\\non an unpoisoned blade.\\n\"Scum!\" Feyd-Rautha gasped.\\nAt the key word, the gladiator\\'s muscles obeyed with a momentary slackness.\\nIt was enough for Feyd-Rautha. He opened a space between them sufficient for the\\nlong blade. Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red line down the slave\\'s\\nchest. There was instant agony in the poison. The man disengaged himself,\\nstaggered backward.\\nNow, let my dear family watch, Feyd-Rautha thought. Let them think on this\\nslave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against me. Let\\nthem wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for such an\\nattempt. And let them always be aware they cannot know for sure which of my\\nhands carries the poison.\\nFeyd-Rautha stood in silence, watching the slowed motions of the slave. The\\nman moved within a hesitation-awareness. There was an orthographic thing on his\\nface now for every watcher to recognize. The death was written there. The slave\\nknew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done. The wrong blade\\nhad carried the poison.\\n\"You!\" the man moaned.\\nFeyd-Rautha drew back to give death its space. The paralyzing drug in the\\npoison had yet to take full effect, but the man\\'s slowness told of its advance.\\nThe slave staggered forward as though drawn by a string--one dragging step\\nat a time. Each step was the only step in his universe. He still clutched his\\nknife, but its point wavered.\\n\"One day . . . one . . . of us . . . will . . . get . . . you,\" he gasped.\\nA sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, sagged, then stiffened and\\nrolled away from Feyd-Rautha, face down.\\nFeyd-Rautha advanced in the silent arena, put a toe under the gladiator and\\nrolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the face when the\\npoison began its twisting, wrenching work on the muscles. But the gladiator came\\nover with his own knife, protruding from his breast.\\nIn spite of frustration, there was for Feyd-Rautha a measure of admiration\\nfor the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the paralysis to do this\\nthing to himself. With the admiration came the realization that here was truly a\\nthing to fear.\\nThat which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.\\nAs he focused on this thought, Feyd-Rautha became conscious of the eruption\\nof noise from the stands and galleries around him. They were cheering with utter\\nabandon.\\nFeyd-Rautha turned, looking up at them.\\n\\n\\x0cAll were cheering except the Baron, who sat with hand to chin in deep\\ncontemplation--and the Count and his lady, both of whom were staring down at\\nhim, their faces masked by smiles.\\nCount Fenring turned to his lady, said: \"Ah-h-h-um-m-m, a resourceful um-mm-m young man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?\"\\n\"His ah-h-h synaptic responses are very swift,\" she said.\\nThe Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena,\\nthinking: If someone could get that close to one of mine! Rage began to replace\\nhis fear. I\\'ll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night . . . and\\nif this Count and his lady had a hand in it . . .\\nThe conversation in the Baron\\'s box was remote movement to Feyd-Rautha, the\\nvoices drowned in the foot-stamping chant that came now from all around:\\n\"Head! Head! Head! Head!\"\\nThe Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd-Rautha turned to him. Languidly,\\ncontrolling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward the young\\nman standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave. Give the boy a\\nhead. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.\\nFeyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: They think they honor me.\\nLet them see what I think!\\nHe saw his handlers approaching with a saw-knife to do the honors, waved\\nthem back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated. They think they honor me with\\njust a head! he thought. He bent and crossed the gladiator\\'s hands around the\\nprotruding knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands.\\nIt was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers. \"Bury\\nthis slave intact with his knife in his hands,\" he said. \"The man earned it.\"\\nIn the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: \"A grand\\ngesture, that--true bravura. Your nephew has style as well as courage.\"\\n\"He insults the crowd by refusing the head,\" the Baron muttered.\\n\"Not at all,\" Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers around\\nthem.\\nAnd the Baron noted the line of her neck--a truly lovely flowing of muscles-like a young boy\\'s.\\n\"They like what your nephew did,\" she said.\\nAs the import of Feyd-Rautha\\'s gesture penetrated to the most distant seats,\\nas the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact, the Baron\\nwatched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly. The people\\nwere going wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping.\\nThe Baron spoke wearily. \"I shall have to order a fete. You cannot send\\npeople home like this, their energies unspent. They must see that I share their\\nelation.\" He gave a hand signal to his guard, and a servant above them dipped\\nthe Harkonnen orange pennant over the box--once, twice, three times--signal for\\na fete.\\nFeyd-Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box, his weapons\\nsheathed, arms hanging at his sides. Above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd,\\nhe called: \"A fete, Uncle?\"\\nThe noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited.\\n\"In your honor, Feyd!\" the Baron called down. And again, he caused the\\npennant to be dipped in signal.\\nAcross the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were\\nleaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha.\\n\"You ordered the pru-shields dropped. Baron?\" the Count asked.\\n\"No one will harm the lad,\" the Baron said. \"He\\'s a hero.\"\\nThe first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their\\nshoulders, began parading around the arena.\\n\"He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of Harko\\ntonight,\" the Baron said. \"They\\'d give him the last of their food and drink just\\nfor his company.\"\\n\\n\\x0cThe Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his\\nsuspensors. \"You will forgive me, please. There are matters that require my\\nimmediate attention. The guard will see you to the keep.\"\\nThe Count arose, bowed. \"Certainly, Baron. We\\'re looking forward to the\\nfete. I\\'ve ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen fete.\"\\n\"Yes,\" the Baron said. \"The fete.\" He turned, was enveloped by guards as he\\nstepped into the private exit from the box.\\nA guard captain bowed to Count Fenring. \"Your orders, my Lord?\"\\n\"We will ah-h-h wait for the worst mm-m-m crush to um-m-m pass,\" the Count\\nsaid.\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\" The man bowed himself back three paces.\\nCount Fenring faced his lady, spoke again in their personal humming-code\\ntongue: \"You saw it, of course?\"\\nIn the same humming tongue, she said: \"The lad knew the gladiator wouldn\\'t\\nbe drugged. There was a moment of fear, yes, but no surprise.\"\\n\"It was planned,\" he said. \"The entire performance.\"\\n\"Without a doubt.\"\\n\"It stinks of Hawat.\"\\n\"Indeed,\" she said.\\n\"I demanded earlier that the Baron eliminate Hawat.\"\\n\"That was an error, my dear.\"\\n\"I see that now.\"\\n\"The Harkonnens may have a new Baron ere long.\"\\n\"If that\\'s Hawat\\'s plan.\"\\n\"That will bear examination, true,\" she said.\\n\"The young one will be more amenable to control.\"\\n\"For us . . . after tonight,\" she said.\\n\"You don\\'t anticipate difficulty seducing him, my little brood-mother?\"\\n\"No, my love. You saw how he looked at me.\"\\n\"Yes, and I can see now why we must have that bloodline.\"\\n\"Indeed, and it\\'s obvious we must have a hold on him. I\\'ll plant deep in his\\ndeepest self the necessary prana-bindu phrases to bend him.\"\\n\"We\\'ll leave as soon as possible--as soon as you\\'re sure,\" he said.\\nShe shuddered. \"By all means. I should not want to bear a child in this\\nterrible place.\"\\n\"The things we do in the name of humanity,\" he said.\\n\"Yours is the easy part,\" she said.\\n\"There are some ancient prejudices I overcome,\" he said. \"They\\'re quite\\nprimordial, you know.\"\\n\"My poor dear,\" she said, and patted his cheek. \"You know this is the only\\nway to be sure of saving that bloodline.\"\\nHe spoke in a dry voice: \"I quite understand what we do.\"\\n\"We won\\'t fail,\" she said.\\n\"Guilt starts as a feeling of failure,\" he reminded.\\n\"There\\'ll be no guilt,\" she said. \"Hypno-ligation of that Feyd-Rautha\\'s\\npsyche and his child in my womb--then we go.\"\\n\"That uncle,\" he said. \"Have you ever seen such distortion?\"\\n\"He\\'s pretty fierce,\" she said, \"but the nephew could well grow to be\\nworse.\"\\n\"Thanks to that uncle. You know, when you think what this lad could\\'ve been\\nwith some other upbringing--with the Atreides code to guide him, for example.\"\\n\"It\\'s sad, \"she said.\\n\"Would that we could\\'ve saved both the Atreides youth and this one. From\\nwhat I heard of that young Paul--a most admirable lad, good union of breeding\\nand training.\" He shook his head. \"But we shouldn\\'t waste sorrow over the\\naristocracy of misfortune.\"\\n\"There\\'s a Bene Gesserit saying,\" she said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"You have sayings for everything!\" he protested.\\n\"You\\'ll like this one,\" she said. \"It goes: \\'Do not count a human dead until\\nyou\\'ve seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.\\' \"\\n', 37: '\\nMuad\\'Dib tells us in \"A Time of Reflection\" that his first collisions with\\nArrakeen necessities were the true beginnings of his education. He learned then\\nhow to pole the sand for its weather, learned the language of the wind\\'s needles\\nstinging his skin, learned how the nose can buzz with sand-itch and how to\\ngather his body\\'s precious moisture around him to guard it and preserve it. As\\nhis eyes assumed the blue of the Ibad, he learned the Chakobsa way.\\n-Stilgar\\'s preface to \"Muad\\'Dib, the Man\" by the Princess Irulan\\nStilgar\\'s troop returning to the sietch with its two strays from the desert\\nclimbed out of the basin in the waning light of the first moon. The robed\\nfigures hurried with the smell of home in their nostrils. Dawn\\'s gray line\\nbehind them was brightest at the notch in their horizon-calendar that marked the\\nmiddle of autumn, the month of Caprock.\\nWind-raked dead leaves strewed the cliffbase where the sietch children had\\nbeen gathering them, but the sounds of the troop\\'s passage (except for\\noccasional blunderings by Paul and his mother) could not be distinguished from\\nthe natural sounds of the night.\\nPaul wiped sweat-caked dust from his forehead, felt a tug at his arm, heard\\nChani\\'s voice hissing. \"Do as I told you: bring the fold of your hood down over\\nyour forehead! Leave only the eyes exposed. You waste moisture.\"\\nA whispered command behind them demanded silence: \"The desert hears you!\"\\nA bird chirruped from the rocks high above them.\\nThe troop stopped, and Paul sensed abrupt tension.\\nThere came a faint thumping from the rocks, a sound no louder than mice\\njumping in the sand.\\nAgain, the bird chirruped.\\nA stir passed through the troop\\'s ranks. And again, the mouse-thumping\\npecked its way across the sand.\\nOnce more, the bird chirruped.\\nThe troop resumed its climb up into a crack in the rocks, but there was a\\nstillness of breath about the Fremen now that filled Paul with caution, and he\\nnoted covert glances toward Chani, the way she seemed to withdraw, pulling in\\nupon herself.\\nThere was rock underfoot now, a faint gray swishing of robes around them,\\nand Paul sensed a relaxing of discipline, but still that quiet-of-the-person\\nabout Chani and the others. He followed a shadow shape--up steps, a turn, more\\nsteps, into a tunnel, past two moisture-sealed doors and into a globelighted\\nnarrow passage with yellow rock walls and ceiling.\\nAll around him, Paul saw the Fremen throwing back their hoods, removing nose\\nplugs, breathing deeply. Someone sighed. Paul looked for Chani, found that she\\nhad left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies. Someone jostled\\nhim, said, \"Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It\\'s always this way.\"\\nOn his left, the narrow bearded face of the one called Farok turned toward\\nPaul. The stained eyepits and blue darkness of eyes appeared even darker under\\nthe yellow globes. \"Throw off your hood, Usul,\" Farok said. \"You\\'re home.\" And\\nhe helped Paul, releasing the hood catch, elbowing a space around them.\\nPaul slipped out his nose plugs, swung the mouth baffle aside. The odor of\\nthe place assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esters of reclaimed wastes,\\neverywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with, over it all, a turbulence of\\nspice and spicelike harmonics.\\n\"Why are we waiting, Farok?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"For the Reverend Mother, I think. You heard the message--poor Chani.\"\\nPoor Chani? Paul asked himself. He looked around, wondering where she was,\\nwhere his mother had got to in all this crush.\\nFarok took a deep breath. \"The smells of home,\" he said.\\nPaul saw that the man was enjoying the stink of this air, that there was no\\nirony in his tone. He heard his mother cough then, and her voice came back to\\nhim through the press of the troop: \"How rich the odors of your sietch, Stilgar.\\nI see you do much working with the spice . . . you make paper . . . plastics . .\\n. and isn\\'t that chemical explosives?\"\\n\"You know this from what you smell?\" It was another man\\'s voice.\\nAnd Paul realized she was speaking for his benefit, that she wanted him to\\nmake a quick acceptance of this assault on his nostrils.\\nThere came a buzz of activity at the head of the troop and a prolonged\\nindrawn breath that seemed to pass through the Fremen, and Paul heard hushed\\nvoices back down the line: \"It\\'s true then--Liet is dead.\"\\nLiet, Paul thought. Then: Chani, daughter of Liet. The pieces fell together\\nin his mind. Liet was the Fremen name of the planetologist.\\nPaul looked at Farok, asked: \"Is it the Liet known as Kynes?\"\\n\"There is only one Liet,\" Farok said.\\nPaul turned, stared at the robed back of a Fremen in front of him. Then\\nLiet-Kynes is dead, he thought.\\n\"It was Harkonnen treachery,\" someone hissed. \"They made it seem an accident\\n. . . lost in the desert . . . a \\'thopter crash . . . \"\\nPaul felt a burst of anger. The man who had befriended them, helped save\\nthem from the Harkonnen hunters, the man who had sent his Fremen cohorts\\nsearching for two strays in the desert . . . another victim of the Harkonnens.\\n\"Does Usul hunger yet for revenge?\" Farok asked.\\nBefore Paul could answer, there came a low call and the troop swept forward\\ninto a wider chamber, carrying Paul with them. He found himself in an open space\\nconfronted by Stilgar and a strange woman wearing a flowing wraparound garment\\nof brilliant orange and green. Her arms were bare to the shoulders, and he could\\nsee she wore no stillsuit. Her skin was a pale olive. Dark hair swept back from\\nher high forehead, throwing emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose\\nbetween the dense darkness of her eyes.\\nShe turned toward him, and Paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies\\ndangling from her ears.\\n\"This bested my Jamis?\" she demanded.\\n\"Be silent, Harah,\" Stilgar said. \"It was Jamis\\' doing--he invoked the\\ntahaddi al-burhan.\"\\n\"He\\'s not but a boy!\" she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from side to\\nside, setting the water tallies to jingling. \"My children made fatherless by\\nanother child? Surely, \\'twas an accident!\"\\n\"Usul, how many years have you?\" Stilgar asked.\\n\"Fifteen standard,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar swept his eyes over the troop. \"Is there one among you cares to\\nchallenge me?\"\\nSilence.\\nStilgar looked at the woman. \"Until I\\'ve learned his weirding ways. I\\'d not\\nchallenge him.\"\\nShe returned his stare. \"But--\"\\n\"You saw the stranger, woman who went with Chani to the Reverend Mother?\"\\nStilgar asked. \"She\\'s an out-freyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad. The mother and\\nson are masters of the weirding ways of battle.\"\\n\"Lisan al-Gaib,\" the woman whispered. Her eyes held awe as she turned them\\nback toward Paul.\\nThe legend again, Paul thought.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Perhaps,\" Stilgar said. \"It hasn\\'t been tested, though.\" He returned his\\nattention to Paul. \"Usul, it\\'s our way that you\\'ve now the responsibility for\\nJamis\\' woman here and for his two sons. His yali . . . his quarters, are yours.\\nHis coffee service is yours . . . and this, his woman.\"\\nPaul studied the woman, wondering: Why isn\\'t she mourning her man? Why does\\nshe show no hate for me? Abruptly, he saw that the Fremen were staring at him,\\nwaiting.\\nSomeone whispered: \"There\\'s work to do. Say how you accept her.\"\\nStilgar said: \"Do you accept Harah as woman or servant?\"\\nHarah lifted her arms, turning slowly on one heel. \"I am still young, Usul.\\nIt\\'s said I still look as young as when I was with Geoff . . . before Jamis\\nbested him.\"\\nJamis killed another to win her, Paul thought.\\nPaul said: \"If I accept her as servant, may I yet change my mind at a later\\ntime?\"\\n\"You\\'d have a year to change your decision,\" Stilgar said. \"After that,\\nshe\\'s a free woman to choose as she wishes . . . or you could free her to choose\\nfor herself at any time. But she\\'s your responsibility, no matter what, for one\\nyear . . . and you\\'ll always share some responsibility for the sons of Jamis.\"\\n\"I accept her as servant,\" Paul said.\\nHarah stamped a foot, shook her shoulders with anger. \"But I\\'m young!\"\\nStilgar looked at Paul, said: \"Caution\\'s a worthy trait in a man who\\'d\\nlead.\"\\n\"But I\\'m young!\" Harah repeated.\\n\"Be silent,\" Stilgar commanded. \"If a thing has merit, it\\'ll be. Show Usul\\nto his quarters and see he has fresh clothing and a place to rest.\"\\n\"Oh-h-h-h!\" she said.\\nPaul had registered enough of her to have a first approximation. He felt the\\nimpatience of the troop, knew many things were being delayed here. He wondered\\nif he dared ask the whereabouts of his mother and Chani, saw from Stilgar\\'s\\nnervous stance that it would be a mistake.\\nHe faced Harah, pitched his voice with tone and tremolo to accent her fear\\nand awe, said: \"Show me my quarters, Harah! We will discuss your youth another\\ntime.\"\\nShe backed away two steps, cast a frightened glance at Stilgar. \"He has the\\nweirding voice,\" she husked.\\n\"Stilgar,\" Paul said. \"Chani\\'s father put heavy obligation on me. If there\\'s\\nanything . . . \"\\n\"It\\'ll be decided in council,\" Stilgar said. \"You can speak then.\" He nodded\\nin dismissal, turned away with the rest of the troop following him.\\nPaul took Harah\\'s arm, noting how cool her flesh seemed, feeling her\\ntremble. \"I\\'ll not harm you, Harah,\" he said. \"Show me our quarters.\" And he\\nsmoothed his voice with relaxants.\\n\"You\\'ll not cast me out when the year\\'s gone?\" she said. \"I know for true\\nI\\'m not as young as once I was.\"\\n\"As long as I live you\\'ll have a place with me,\" he said. He released her\\narm. \"Come now, where are our quarters?\"\\nShe turned, led the way down the passage, turning right into a wide cross\\ntunnel lighted by evenly spaced yellow overhead globes. The stone floor was\\nsmooth, swept clean of sand.\\nPaul moved up beside her, studied the aquiline profile as they walked. \"You\\ndo not hate me, Harah?\"\\n\"Why should I hate you?\"\\nShe nodded to a cluster of children who stared at them from the raised ledge\\nof a side passage. Paul glimpsed adult shapes behind the children partly hidden\\nby filmy hangings.\\n\"I . . . bested Jamis.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Stilgar said the ceremony was held and you\\'re a friend of Jamis.\" She\\nglanced sidelong at him. \"Stilgar said you gave moisture to the dead. Is that\\ntruth?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"It\\'s more than I\\'ll do . . . can do.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you mourn him?\"\\n\"In the time of mourning, I\\'ll mourn him.\"\\nThey passed an arched opening. Paul looked through it at men and women\\nworking with stand-mounted machinery in a large, bright chamber. There seemed an\\nextra tempo of urgency to them.\\n\"What\\'re they doing in there?\" Paul asked.\\nShe glanced back as they passed beyond the arch, said: \"They hurry to finish\\nthe quota in the plastics shop before we flee. We need many dew collectors for\\nthe planting.\"\\n\"Flee?\"\\n\"Until the butchers stop hunting us or are driven from our land.\"\\nPaul caught himself in a stumble, sensing an arrested instant of time,\\nremembering a fragment, a visual projection of prescience--but it was displaced,\\nlike a montage in motion. The bits of his prescient memory were not quite as he\\nremembered them.\\n\"The Sardaukar hunt us,\" he said.\\n\"They\\'ll not find much excepting an empty sietch or two,\" she said. \"And\\nthey\\'ll find their share of death in the sand.\"\\n\"They\\'ll find this place?\" he asked.\\n\"Likely.\"\\n\"Yet we take the time to . . . \" He motioned with his head toward the arch\\nnow far behind them. \" . . . make . . . dew collectors?\"\\n\"The planting goes on.\"\\n\"What\\'re dew collectors?\" he asked.\\nThe glance she turned on him was full of surprise. \"Don\\'t they teach you\\nanything in the . . . wherever it is you come from?\"\\n\"Not about dew collectors.\"\\n\"Hai!\" she said, and there was a whole conversation in the one word.\\n\"Well, what are they?\"\\n\"Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg,\" she said, \"how do you\\nsuppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted most tenderly in its own\\nlittle pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns\\nthem white. You can see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high\\nplace. White reflects. But when Old Father Sun departs, the chromoplastic\\nreverts to transparency in the dark. It cools with extreme rapidity. The surface\\ncondenses moisture out of the air. That moisture trickles down to keep our\\nplants alive.\"\\n\"Dew collectors,\" he muttered, enchanted by the simple beauty of such a\\nscheme.\\n\"I\\'ll mourn Jamis in the proper time for it,\" she said, as though her mind\\nhad not left his other question. \"He was a good man, Jamis, but quick to anger.\\nA good provider, Jamis, and a wonder with the children. He made no separation\\nbetween Geoff\\'s boy, my firstborn, and his own true son. They were equal in his\\neyes.\" She turned a questing stare on Paul. \"Would it be that way with you,\\nUsul?\"\\n\"We don\\'t have that problem.\"\\n\"But if--\"\\n\"Harah!\"\\nShe recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice.\\nThey passed another brightly lighted room visible through an arch on their\\nleft. \"What\\'s made there?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"They repair the weaving machinery,\" she said. \"But it must be dismantled by\\ntonight.\" She gestured at a tunnel branching to their left. \"Through there and\\nbeyond, that\\'s food processing and stillsuit maintenance.\" She looked at Paul.\\n\"Your suit looks new. But if it needs work, I\\'m good with suits. I work in the\\nfactory in season.\"\\nThey began coming on knots of people now and thicker clusterings of openings\\nin the tunnel\\'s sides. A file of men and women passed them carrying packs that\\ngurgled heavily, the smell of spice strong about them.\\n\"They\\'ll not get our water,\" Harah said. \"Or our spice. You can be sure of\\nthat.\"\\nPaul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets\\non the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled\\ncushions. People in the openings fell silent at their approach, followed Paul\\nwith untamed stares.\\n\"The people find it strange you bested Jamis,\" Harah said. \"Likely you\\'ll\\nhave some proving to do when we\\'re settled in a new sietch.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like killing,\" he said.\\n\"Thus Stilgar tells it,\" she said, but her voice betrayed her disbelief.\\nA shrill chanting grew louder ahead of them. They came to another side\\nopening wider than any of the others Paul had seen. He slowed his pace, staring\\nin at a room crowded with children sitting cross-legged on a maroon-carpeted\\nfloor.\\nAt a chalkboard against the far wall stood a woman in a yellow wraparound, a\\nprojecto-stylus in one hand. The board was filled with designs--circles, wedges\\nand curves, snake tracks and squares, flowing arcs split by parallel lines. The\\nwoman pointed to the designs one after the other as fast as she could move the\\nstylus, and the children chanted in rhythm with her moving hand.\\nPaul listened, hearing the voices grow dimmer behind as he moved deeper into\\nthe sietch with Harah.\\n\"Tree,\" the children chanted. \"Tree, grass, dune, wind, mountain, hill,\\nfire, lightning, rock, rocks, dust, sand, heat, shelter, heat, full, winter,\\ncold, empty, erosion, summer, cavern, day, tension, moon, night, caprock,\\nsandtide, slope, planting, binder . . . \"\\n\"You conduct classes at a time like this?\" Paul asked.\\nHer face went somber and grief edged her voice: \"What Liet taught us, we\\ncannot pause an instant in that. Liet who is dead must not be forgotten. It\\'s\\nthe Chakobsa way.\"\\nShe crossed the tunnel to the left, stepped up onto a ledge, parted gauzy\\norange hangings and stood aside: \"Your yali is ready for you, Usul.\"\\nPaul hesitated before joining her on the ledge. He felt a sudden reluctance\\nto be alone with this woman. It came to him that he was surrounded by a way of\\nlife that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and\\nvalues. He felt that this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare him\\nin its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare--the wild jihad, the religious\\nwar he felt he should avoid at any cost.\\n\"This is your yali,\" Harah said. \"Why do you hesitate?\"\\nPaul nodded, joined her on the ledge. He lifted the hangings across from\\nher, feeling metal fibers in the fabric, followed her into a short entrance way\\nand then into a larger room, square, about six meters to a side--thick blue\\ncarpets on the floor, blue and green fabrics hiding the rock walls, glowglobes\\ntuned to yellow overhead bobbing against draped yellow ceiling fabrics.\\nThe effect was that of an ancient tent.\\nHarah stood in front of him, left hand on hip, her eyes studying his face.\\n\"The children are with a friend,\" she said. \"They will present themselves\\nlater.\"\\nPaul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room. Thin hangings\\nto the right, he saw, partly concealed a larger room with cushions piled around\\n\\n\\x0cthe walls. He felt a soft breeze from an air duct, saw the outlet cunningly\\nhidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead of him.\\n\"Do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit?\" Harah asked.\\n\"No . . . thank you.\"\\n\"Shall I bring food?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"There is a reclamation chamber off the other room.\" She gestured. \"For your\\ncomfort and convenience when you\\'re out of your stillsuit.\"\\n\"You said we have to leave this sietch,\" Paul said. \"Shouldn\\'t we be packing\\nor something?\"\\n\"It will be done in its time,\" she said. \"The butchers have yet to penetrate\\nto our region.\"\\nStill she hesitated, staring at him.\\n\"What is it?\" he demanded.\\n\"You\\'ve not the eyes of the Ibad,\" she said. \"It\\'s strange but not entirely\\nunattractive.\"\\n\"Get the food,\" he said. \"I\\'m hungry.\"\\nShe smiled at him--a knowing, woman\\'s smile that he found disquieting. \"I am\\nyour servant,\" she said, and whirled away in one lithe motion, ducking behind a\\nheavy wall hanging that revealed another passage before falling back into place.\\nFeeling angry with himself, Paul brushed through the thin hanging on the\\nright and into the larger room. He stood there a moment caught by uncertainty.\\nAnd he wondered where Chani was . . . Chani who had just lost her father.\\nWe\\'re alike in that, he thought.\\nA wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors, its volume muffled by the\\nintervening hangings. It was repeated, a bit more distant. And again. Paul\\nrealized someone was calling the time. He focused on the fact that he had seen\\nno clocks.\\nThe faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils, riding on the\\nomnipresent stink of the sietch. Paul saw that he had already suppressed the\\nodorous assault on his senses.\\nAnd he wondered again about his mother, how the moving montage of the future\\nwould incorporate her . . . and the daughter she bore. Mutable time-awareness\\ndanced around him. He shook his head sharply, focusing his attention on the\\nevidences that spoke of profound depth and breadth in this Fremen culture that\\nhad swallowed them.\\nWith its subtle oddities.\\nHe had seen a thing about the caverns and this room, a thing that suggested\\nfar greater differences than anything he had yet encountered.\\nThere was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use\\nanywhere in the cave warren. Yet he could smell poisons in the sietch stench-strong ones, common ones.\\nHe heard a rustle of hangings, thought it was Harah returning with food, and\\nturned to watch her. Instead, from beneath a displaced pattern of hangings, he\\nsaw two young boys--perhaps aged nine and ten--staring out at him with greedy\\neyes. Each wore a small kindjal-type of crysknife, rested a hand on the hilt.\\nAnd Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen--that their children fought as\\nferociously as the adults.\\n', 38: '\\nThe hands move, the lips move -Ideas gush from his words,\\nAnd his eyes devour!\\nHe is an island of Selfdom.\\n-description from \"A Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\n\\x0cPhosphortubes in the faraway upper reaches of the cavern cast a dim light\\nonto the thronged interior, hinting at the great size of this rock-enclosed\\nspace . . . larger, Jessica saw, than even the Gathering Hall of her Bene\\nGesserit school. She estimated there were more than five thousand people\\ngathered out there beneath the ledge where she stood with Stilgar.\\nAnd more were coming.\\nThe air was murmurous with people.\\n\"Your son has been summoned from his rest, Sayyadina,\" Stilgar said. \"Do you\\nwish him to share in your decision?\"\\n\"Could he change my decision?\"\\n\"Certainly, the air with which you speak comes from your own lungs, but--\"\\n\"The decision stands,\" she said.\\nBut she felt misgivings, wondering if she should use Paul as an excuse for\\nbacking out of a dangerous course. There was an unborn daughter to think of as\\nwell. What endangered the flesh of the mother endangered the flesh of the\\ndaughter.\\nMen came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them, stirring up\\ndust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge.\\nStilgar took her arm, led her back into the acoustical horn that formed the\\nrear limits of the ledge. He indicated a rock bench within the horn. \"The\\nReverend Mother will sit here, but you may rest yourself until she comes.\"\\n\"I prefer to stand,\" Jessica said.\\nShe watched the men unroll the carpets, covering the ledge, looked out at\\nthe crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor now.\\nAnd still they came.\\nOut on the desert, she knew, it already was red nightfall, but here in the\\ncavern hall was perpetual twilight, a gray vastness thronged with people come to\\nsee her risk her life.\\nA way was opened through the crowd to her right, and she saw Paul\\napproaching flanked by two small boys. There was a swaggering air of self-importance about the children. They kept hands on knives, scowled at the wall of\\npeople on either side.\\n\"The sons of Jamis who are now the sons of Usul,\" Stilgar said. \"They take\\ntheir escort duties seriously.\" He ventured a smile at Jessica.\\nJessica recognized the effort to lighten her mood and was grateful for it,\\nbut could not take her mind from the danger that confronted her.\\nI had no choice but to do this, she thought. We must move swiftly if we\\'re\\nto secure our place among these Fremen.\\nPaul climbed to the ledge, leaving the children below. He stopped in front\\nof his mother, glanced at Stilgar, back to Jessica. \"What is happening? I\\nthought I was being summoned to council.\"\\nStilgar raised a hand for silence, gestured to his left where another way\\nhad been opened in the throng. Chani came down the lane opened there, her elfin\\nface set in lines of grief. She had removed her stillsuit and wore a graceful\\nblue wraparound that exposed her thin arms. Near the shoulder on her left arm, a\\ngreen kerchief had been tied.\\nGreen for mourning, Paul thought.\\nIt was one of the customs the two sons of Jamis had explained to him by\\nindirection, telling him they wore no green because they accepted him as\\nguardian-father.\\n\"Are you the Lisan al-Gaib?\" they had asked. And Paul had sensed the jihad\\nin their words, shrugged off the question with one of his own--learning then\\nthat Kaleff, the elder of the two, was ten, and the natural son of Geoff. Orlop,\\nthe younger, was eight, the natural son of Jamis.\\nIt had been a strange day with these two standing guard over him because he\\nasked it, keeping away the curious, allowing him the time to nurse his thoughts\\nand prescient memories, to plan a way to prevent the jihad.\\n\\n\\x0cNow, standing beside his mother on the cavern ledge and looking out at the\\nthrong, he wondered if any plan could prevent the wild outpouring of fanatic\\nlegions.\\nChani, nearing the ledge, was followed at a distance by four women carrying\\nanother woman in a litter.\\nJessica ignored Chani\\'s approach, focusing all her attention on the woman in\\nthe litter--a crone, a wrinkled and shriveled ancient thing in a black gown with\\nhood thrown back to reveal the tight knot of gray hair and the stringy neck.\\nThe litter-carriers deposited their burden gently on the ledge from below,\\nand Chani helped the old woman to her feet.\\nSo this is their Reverend Mother, Jessica thought.\\nThe old woman leaned heavily on Chani as she hobbled toward Jessica, looking\\nlike a collection of sticks draped in the black robe. She stopped in front of\\nJessica, peered upward for a long moment before speaking in a husky whisper.\\n\"So you\\'re the one.\" The old head nodded once precariously on the thin neck.\\n\"The Shadout Mapes was right to pity you.\"\\nJessica spoke quickly, scornfully: \"I need no one\\'s pity.\"\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" husked the old woman. She turned with surprising\\nquickness and faced the throng. \"Tell them, Stilgar.\"\\n\"Must I?\" he asked.\\n\"We are the people of Misr,\" the old woman rasped. \"Since our Sunni\\nancestors fled from Nilotic al-Ourouba, we have known flight and death. The\\nyoung go on that our people shall not die.\"\\nStilgar took a deep breath, stepped forward two paces.\\nJessica felt the hush come over the crowded cavern--some twenty thousand\\npeople now, standing silently, almost without movement. It made her feel\\nsuddenly small and filled with caution.\\n\"Tonight we must leave this sietch that has sheltered us for so long and go\\nsouth into the desert,\" Stilgar said. His voice boomed out across the uplifted\\nfaces, reverberating with the force given it by the acoustical horn behind the\\nledge.\\nStill the throng remained silent.\\n\"The Reverend Mother tells me she cannot survive another hajra,\" Stilgar\\nsaid. \"We have lived before without a Reverend Mother, but it is not good for\\npeople to seek a new home in such straits.\"\\nNow, the throng stirred, rippling with whispers and currents of disquiet.\\n\"That this may not come to pass,\" Stilgar said, \"our new Sayyadina Jessica\\nof the Weirding, has consented to enter the rite at this time. She will attempt\\nto pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother.\"\\nJessica of the Weirding, Jessica thought. She saw Paul staring at her, his\\neyes filled with questions, but his mouth held silent by all the strangeness\\naround them.\\nIf I die in the attempt, what will become of him? Jessica asked herself.\\nAgain she felt the misgivings fill her mind.\\nChani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical\\nhorn, returned to stand beside Stilgar.\\n\"That we may not lose all if Jessica of the Weirding should fail,\" Stilgar\\nsaid, \"Chani, daughter of Liet, will be consecrated in the Sayyadina at this\\ntime.\" He stepped one pace to the side.\\nFrom deep in the acoustical horn, the old woman\\'s voice came out to them, an\\namplified whisper, harsh and penetrating: \"Chani has returned from her hajra-Chani has seen the waters.\"\\nA sussurant response arose from the crowd: \"She has seen the waters.\"\\n\"I consecrate the daughter of Liet in the Sayyadina,\" husked the old woman.\\n\"She is accepted,\" the crowd responded.\\nPaul barely heard the ceremony, his attention still centered on what had\\nbeen said of his mother.\\n\\n\\x0cIf she should fail?\\nHe turned and looked back at the one they called Reverend Mother, studying\\nthe dried crone features, the fathomless blue fixation of her eyes. She looked\\nas though a breeze would blow her away, yet there was that about her which\\nsuggested she might stand untouched in the path of a coriolis storm. She carried\\nthe same aura of power that he remembered from the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen\\nMohiam who had tested him with agony in the way of the gom jabbar.\\n\"I, the Reverend Mother Ramallo, whose voice speaks as a multitude, say this\\nto you,\" the old woman said. \"It is fitting that Chani enter the Sayyadina.\"\\n\"It is fitting,\" the crowd responded.\\nThe old woman nodded, whispered: \"I give her the silver skies, the golden\\ndesert and its shining rocks, the green fields that will be. I give these to\\nSayyadina Chani. And lest she forget that she\\'s servant of us all, to her fall\\nthe menial tasks in this Ceremony of the Seed. Let it be as Shai-hulud will have\\nit.\" She lifted a brown-stick arm, dropped it.\\nJessica, feeling the ceremony close around her with a current that swept her\\nbeyond all turning back, glanced once at Paul\\'s question filled face, then\\nprepared herself for the ordeal.\\n\"Let the watermasters come forward,\" Chani said with only the slightest\\nquaver of uncertainty in her girl-child voice.\\nNow, Jessica felt herself at the focus of danger, knowing its presence in\\nthe watchfulness of the throng, in the silence.\\nA band of men made its way through a serpentine path opened in the crowd,\\nmoving up from the back in pairs. Each pair carried a small skin sack, perhaps\\ntwice the size of a human head. The sacks sloshed heavily.\\nThe two leaders deposited their load at Chani\\'s feet on the ledge and\\nstepped back.\\nJessica looked at the sack, then at the men. They had their hoods thrown\\nback, exposing long hair tied in a roll at the base of the neck. The black pits\\nof their eyes stared back at her without wavering.\\nA furry redolence of cinnamon arose from the sack, wafted across Jessica.\\nThe spice? she wondered.\\n\"Is there water?\" Chani asked.\\nThe watermaster on the left, a man with a purple scar line across the bridge\\nof his nose, nodded once. \"There is water, Sayyadina,\" he said, \"but we cannot\\ndrink of it.\"\\n\"Is there seed?\" Chani asked.\\n\"There is seed,\" the man said.\\nChani knelt and put her hands to the sloshing sack. \"Blessed is the water\\nand its seed.\"\\nThere was familiarity to the rite, and Jessica looked back at the Reverend\\nMother Ramallo. The old woman\\'s eyes were closed and she sat hunched over as\\nthough asleep.\\n\"Sayyadina Jessica,\" Chani said.\\nJessica turned to see the girl staring up at her.\\n\"Have you tasted the blessed water?\" Chani asked.\\nBefore Jessica could answer, Chani said: \"It is not possible that you have\\ntasted the blessed water. You are outworlder and unprivileged.\"\\nA sigh passed through the crowd, a sussuration of robes that made the nape\\nhairs creep on Jessica\\'s neck.\\n\"The crop was large and the maker has been destroyed,\" Chani said. She began\\nunfastening a coiled spout fixed to the top of the sloshing sack.\\nNow, Jessica felt the sense of danger boiling around her. She glanced at\\nPaul, saw that he was caught up in the mystery of the ritual and had eyes only\\nfor Chani.\\n\\n\\x0cHas he seen this moment in time? Jessica wondered. She rested a hand on her\\nabdomen, thinking of the unborn daughter there, asking herself: Do I have the\\nright to risk us both?\\nChani lifted the spout toward Jessica, said: \"Here is the Water of Life, the\\nwater that is greater than water--Kan, the water that frees the soul. If you be\\na Reverend Mother, it opens the universe to you. Let Shai-hulud judge now.\"\\nJessica felt herself torn between duty to her unborn child and duty to Paul.\\nFor Paul, she knew, she should take that spout and drink of the sack\\'s contents,\\nbut as she bent to the proffered spout, her senses told her its peril.\\nThe stuff in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin to many poisons that\\nshe knew, but unlike them, too.\\n\"You must drink it now,\" Chani said.\\nThere\\'s no turning back, Jessica reminded herself. But nothing in all her\\nBene Gesserit training came into her mind to help her through this instant.\\nWhat is it? Jessica asked, herself. Liquor? A drug?\\nShe bent over the spout, smelled the esters of cinnamon, remembering then\\nthe drunkenness of Duncan Idaho. Spice liquor? she asked herself. She took the\\nsiphon tube in her mouth, pulled up only the most minuscule sip. It tasted of\\nthe spice, a faint bite acrid on the tongue.\\nChani pressed down on the skin bag. A great gulp of the stuff surged into\\nJessica\\'s mouth and before she could help herself, she swallowed it, fighting to\\nretain her calmness and dignity.\\n\"To accept a little death is worse than death itself,\" Chani said. She\\nstared at Jessica, waiting.\\nAnd Jessica stared back, still holding the spout in her mouth. She tasted\\nthe sack\\'s contents in her nostrils, in the roof of her mouth, in her cheeks, in\\nher eyes--a biting sweetness, now.\\nCool.\\nAgain, Chani sent the liquid gushing into Jessica\\'s mouth.\\nDelicate.\\nJessica studied Chani\\'s face--elfin features--seeing the traces of Liet-Kynes there as yet unfixed by time.\\nThis is a drug they feed me, Jessica told herself.\\nBut it was unlike any other drug of her experience, and Bene Gesserit\\ntraining included the taste of many drugs.\\nChani\\'s features were so clear, as though outlined in light.\\nA drug.\\nWhirling silence settled around Jessica. Every fiber of her body accepted\\nthe fact that something profound had happened to it. She felt that she was a\\nconscious mote, smaller than any subatomic particle, yet capable of motion and\\nof sensing her surroundings. Like an abrupt revelation--the curtains whipped\\naway--she realized she had become aware of a psychokinesthetic extension of\\nherself. She was the mote, yet not the mote.\\nThe cavern remained around her--the people. She sensed them: Paul, Chani,\\nStilgar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo.\\nReverend Mother!\\nAt the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the Reverend\\nMother ordeal, that the drug took them.\\nJessica focused her attention on the Reverend Mother Ramallo, aware now that\\nall this was happening in a frozen instant of time--suspended time for her\\nalone.\\nWhy is time suspended? she asked herself. She stared at the frozen\\nexpressions around her, seeing a dust mote above Chani\\'s head, stopped there.\\nWaiting.\\nThe answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness: her\\npersonal time was suspended to save her life.\\n\\n\\x0cShe focused on the psychokinesthetic extension of herself, looking within,\\nand was confronted immediately with a cellular core, a pit of blackness from\\nwhich she recoiled.\\nThat is the place where we cannot look, she thought. There is the place the\\nReverend Mothers are so reluctant to mention--the place where only a Kwisatz\\nHaderach may look.\\nThis realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she\\nventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a mote-self that\\nsearched within her for danger.\\nShe found it within the drug she had swallowed.\\nThe stuff was dancing particles within her, its motions so rapid that even\\nfrozen time could not stop them. Dancing particles. She began recognizing\\nfamiliar structures, atomic linkages: a carbon atom here, helical wavering . . .\\na glucose molecule. An entire chain of molecules confronted her, and she\\nrecognized a protein . . . a methyl-protein configuration.\\nAh-h-h!\\nIt was a soundless mental sigh within her as she saw the nature of the\\npoison.\\nWith her psychokinesthetic probing, she moved into it, shifted an oxygen\\nmote, allowed another carbon mote to link, reattached a linkage of oxygen . . .\\nhydrogen.\\nThe change spread . . . faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened\\nits surface of contact.\\nThe suspension of time relaxed its hold upon her, and she sensed motion. The\\ntube spout from the sack was touched to her mouth--gently, collecting a drop of\\nmoisture.\\nChani\\'s taking the catalyst from my body to change the poison in that sack,\\nJessica thought. Why?\\nSomeone eased her to a sitting position. She saw the old Reverend Mother\\nRamallo being brought to sit beside her on the carpeted ledge. A dry hand\\ntouched her neck.\\nAnd there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness! Jessica\\ntried to reject it, but the mote swept closer . . . closer.\\nThey touched!\\nIt was like an ultimate simpatico, being two people at once: not telepathy,\\nbut mutual awareness.\\nWith the old Reverend Mother!\\nBut Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn\\'t think of herself as old. An\\nimage unfolded before the mutual mind\\'s eye: a young girl with a dancing spirit\\nand tender humor.\\nWithin the mutual awareness, the young girl said, \"Yes, that is how I am.\"\\nJessica could only accept the words, not respond to them.\\n\"You\\'ll have it all soon, Jessica,\" the inward image said.\\nThis is hallucination, Jessica told herself.\\n\"You know better than that,\" the inward image said. \"Swiftly now, do not\\nfight me. There isn\\'t much time. We . . . \" There came a long pause, then; \"You\\nshould\\'ve told us you were pregnant!\"\\nJessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. \"Why?\"\\n\"This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?\"\\nJessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness, saw another motepresence with the inward eye. The other mote darted wildly here, there,\\ncircling. It radiated pure terror.\\n\"You\\'ll have to be strong,\" the old Reverend Mother\\'s image-presence said.\\n\"Be thankful it\\'s a daughter you carry. This would\\'ve killed a male fetus. Now .\\n. . carefully, gently . . . touch your daughter-presence. Be your daughter-presence. Absorb the fear . . . soothe . . . use your courage and your strength\\n. . . gently now . . . gently . . . \"\\n\\n\\x0cThe other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch\\nit.\\nTerror threatened to overwhelm her.\\nShe fought it the only way she knew: \"I shall not fear. Fear is the mind\\nkiller . . . \"\\nThe litany brought a semblance of calm. The other mote lay quiescent against\\nher.\\nWords won\\'t work, Jessica told herself.\\nShe reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a\\nwarm snuggling of protection.\\nThe terror receded.\\nAgain, the presence of the old Reverend Mother asserted itself, but now\\nthere was a tripling of mutual awareness--two active and one that lay quietly\\nabsorbing.\\n\"Time compels me,\" the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. \"I have\\nmuch to give you. And I do not know if your daughter can accept all this while\\nremaining sane. But it must be: the needs of the tribe are paramount.\"\\n\"What--\"\\n\"Remain silent and accept!\"\\nExperiences began to unroll before Jessica. It was like a lecture strip in a\\nsubliminal training projector at the Bene Gesserit school . . . but faster . . .\\nblindingly faster.\\nYet . . . distinct.\\nShe knew each experience as it happened: there was a lover--virile, bearded,\\nwith the Fremen eyes, and Jessica saw his strength and tenderness, all of him in\\none blink-moment, through the Reverend Mother\\'s memory.\\nThere was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the daughter\\nfetus, only time to accept and record. The experiences poured in on Jessica-birth, life, death--important matters and unimportant, an outpouring of singleview time.\\nWhy should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory? she asked\\nherself.\\nToo late, Jessica saw what was happening: the old woman was dying and, in\\ndying, pouring her experiences into Jessica\\'s awareness as water is poured into\\na cup. The other mote faded back into pre-birth awareness as Jessica watched it.\\nAnd, dying-in-conception, the old Reverend Mother left her life in Jessica\\'s\\nmemory with one last sighing blur of words.\\n\"I\\'ve been a long time waiting for you,\" she said. \"Here is my life.\"\\nThere it was, encapsuled, all of it.\\nEven the moment of death.\\nI am now a Reverend Mother, Jessica realized.\\nAnd she knew with a generalized awareness that she had become, in truth,\\nprecisely what was meant by a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. The poison drug had\\ntransformed her.\\nThis wasn\\'t exactly how they did it at the Bene Gesserit school, she knew.\\nNo one had ever introduced her to the mysteries of it, but she knew.\\nThe end result was the same.\\nJessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness, probed\\nit without response.\\nA terrible sense of loneliness crept through Jessica in the realization of\\nwhat had happened to her. She saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed and\\nall life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer.\\nThe sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as her\\nbody relaxed from the threat of the poison, but still she felt that other mote,\\ntouching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it.\\nI did it, my poor, unformed, dear little daughter, I brought you into this\\nuniverse and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any defenses.\\n\\n\\x0cA tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured\\ninto it, came from the other mote.\\nBefore Jessica could respond, she felt the adab presence of demanding\\nmemory. There was something that needed doing. She groped for it, realizing she\\nwas being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her senses.\\nI could change that, she thought. I could take away the drug action and make\\nit harmless. But she sensed this would be an error. I\\'m within a rite of\\njoining.\\nThen she knew what she had to do.\\nJessica opened her eyes, gestured to the watersack now being held above her\\nby Chani.\\n\"It has been blessed,\" Jessica said. \"Mingle the waters, let the change come\\nto all, that the people may partake and share in the blessing.\"\\nLet the catalyst do its work, she thought. Let the people drink of it and\\nhave their awareness of each other heightened for awhile. The drug is safe now .\\n. . now that a Reverend Mother has changed it.\\nStill, the demanding memory worked on her, thrusting. There was another\\nthing she had to do, she realized, but the drug made it difficult to focus.\\nAh-h-h-h-h . . . the old Reverend Mother.\\n\"I have met the Reverend Mother Ramallo,\" Jessica said. \"She is gone, but\\nshe remains. Let her memory be honored in the rite.\\nNow, where did I get those words? Jessica wondered.\\nAnd she realized they came from another memory, the life that had been given\\nto her and now was part of herself. Something about that gift felt incomplete,\\nthough.\\n\"Let them have their orgy,\" the other-memory said within her. \"They\\'ve\\nlittle enough pleasure out of living. Yes, and you and I need this little time\\nto become acquainted before I recede and pour out through your memories.\\nAlready, I feel myself being tied to bits of you. Ah-h-h, you\\'ve a mind filled\\nwith interesting things. So many things I\\'d never imagined.\"\\nAnd the memory-mind encapsulated within her opened itself to Jessica,\\npermitting a view down a wide corridor to other Reverend Mothers until there\\nseemed no end to them.\\nJessica recoiled, fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness.\\nStill, the corridor remained, revealing to Jessica that the Fremen culture was\\nfar older than she had suspected.\\nThere had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an easy\\nplanet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on\\nBela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus.\\nOh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting.\\nFar down the corridor, an image-voice screamed: \"They denied us the Hajj!\"\\nJessica saw the slave cribs on Bela Tegeuse down that inner corridor, saw\\nthe weeding out and the selecting that spread men to Rossak and Harmonthep.\\nScenes of brutal ferocity opened to her like the petals of a terrible flower.\\nAnd she saw the thread of the past carried by Sayyadina after Sayyadina--first\\nby word of mouth, hidden in the sand chanteys, then refined through their own\\nReverend Mothers with the discovery of the poison drug on Rossak . . . and now\\ndeveloped to subtle strengthen Arrakis in the discovery of the Water of Life.\\nFar down the inner corridor, another voice screamed: \"Never to forgive!\\nNever to forget!\"\\nBut Jessica\\'s attention was focused on the revelation of the Water of Life,\\nseeing its source: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm, a maker. And as\\nshe saw the killing of it in her new memory, she suppressed a gasp.\\nThe creature was drowned!\\n\"Mother, are you all right?\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul\\'s voice intruded on her, and Jessica struggled out of the inner\\nawareness to stare up at him, conscious of duty to him, but resenting his\\npresence.\\nI\\'m like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the\\nfirst moment of awareness--until one day the ability to feel is forced into\\nthem.\\nThe thought hung in her mind, an enclosing awareness.\\nAnd I say: \"Look! I have no hands!\" But the people all around me say: \"What\\nare hands?\" \"\\n\"Are you all right?\" Paul repeated.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Is this all right for me to drink?\" He gestured to the sack in Chani\\'s\\nhands. \"They want me to drink it.\"\\nShe heard the hidden meaning in his words, realized he had detected the\\npoison in the original, unchanged substance, that he was concerned for her. It\\noccurred to Jessica then to wonder about the limits of Paul\\'s prescience. His\\nquestion revealed much to her.\\n\"You may drink it,\" she said. \"It has been changed.\" And she looked beyond\\nhim to see Stilgar staring down at her, the dark-dark eyes studying.\\n\"Now, we know you cannot be false,\" he said.\\nShe sensed hidden meaning here, too, but the muzziness of the drug was\\noverpowering her senses. How warm it was and soothing. How beneficent these\\nFremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship.\\nPaul saw the drug take hold of his mother.\\nHe searched his memory--the fixed past, the flux-lines of the possible\\nfutures. It was like scanning through arrested instants of time, disconcerting\\nto the lens of the inner eye. The fragments were difficult to understand when\\nsnatched out of the flux.\\nThis drug--he could assemble knowledge about it, understand what it was\\ndoing to his mother, but the knowledge lacked a natural rhythm, lacked a system\\nof mutual reflection.\\nHe realized suddenly that it was one thing to see the past occupying the\\npresent, but the true test of prescience was to see the past in the future.\\nThings persisted in not being what they seemed.\\n\"Drink it,\" Chani said. She waved the hornspout of a watersack under his\\nnose.\\nPaul straightened, staring at Chani. He felt carnival excitement in the air.\\nHe knew what would happen if he drank this spice drug with its quintessence of\\nthe substance that brought the change onto him. He would return to the vision of\\npure time, of time-become-space. It would perch him on the dizzying summit and\\ndefy him to understand.\\nFrom behind Chani, Stilgar said: \"Drink it, lad. You delay the rite.\"\\nPaul listened to the crowd then, hearing the wildness in their voices-\"Lisan al-Gaib,\" they said. \"Muad\\'Dib!\" He looked down at his mother. She\\nappeared peacefully asleep in a sitting position--her breathing even and deep. A\\nphrase out of the future that was his lonely past came into his mind: \"She\\nsleeps in the Waters of Life.\"\\nChani tugged at his sleeve.\\nPaul took the hornspout into his mouth, hearing the people shout. He felt\\nthe liquid gush into his throat as Chani pressed the sack, sensed giddiness in\\nthe fumes. Chani removed the spout, handed the sack into hands that reached for\\nit from the floor of the cavern. His eyes focused on her arm, the green band of\\nmourning there.\\nAs she straightened, Chani saw the direction of his gaze, said: \"I can mourn\\nhim even in the happiness of the waters. This was something he gave us.\" She put\\nher hand into his, pulling him along the ledge. \"We are alike in a thing, Usul:\\nWe have each lost a father to the Harkonnens.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul followed her. He felt that his head had been separated from his body\\nand restored with odd connections. His legs were remote and rubbery.\\nThey entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by spaced-out\\nglowglobes. Paul felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him,\\nopening time like a flower. He found need to steady himself against Chani as\\nthey turned through another shadowed tunnel. The mixture of whipcord and\\nsoftness he felt beneath her robe stirred his blood. The sensation mingled with\\nthe work of the drug, folding future and past into the present, leaving him the\\nthinnest margin of trinocular focus.\\n\"I know you, Chani,\" he whispered. \"We\\'ve sat upon a ledge above the sand\\nwhile I soothed your fears. We\\'ve caressed in the dark of the sietch. We\\'ve . .\\n. \" He found himself losing focus, tried to shake his head, stumbled.\\nChani steadied him, led him through thick hangings into the yellow warmth of\\na private apartment--tow tables, cushions, a sleeping pad beneath an orange\\nspread.\\nPaul grew aware that they had stopped, that Chani stood facing him, and that\\nher eyes betrayed a look of quiet terror.\\n\"You must tell me,\" she whispered.\\n\"You are Sihaya,\" he said, \"the desert spring.\"\\n\"When the tribe shares the Water,\" she said, \"we\\'re together--all of us. We\\n. . . share. I can . . . sense the others with me, but I\\'m afraid to share with\\nyou.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\nHe tried to focus on her, but past and future were merging into the present,\\nblurring her image. He saw her in countless ways and positions and settings.\\n\"There\\'s something frightening in you,\" she said. \"When I took you away from\\nthe others . . . I did it because I could feel what the others wanted. You . . .\\npress on people. You . . . make us see things!\"\\nHe forced himself to speak distinctly: \"What do you see?\"\\nShe looked down at her hands. \"I see a child . . . in my arms. It\\'s our\\nchild, yours and mine.\" She put a hand to her mouth. \"How can I know every\\nfeature of you?\"\\nThey\\'ve a little of the talent, his mind told him. But they suppress it\\nbecause it terrifies.\\nIn a moment of clarity, he saw how Chani was trembling.\\n\"What is it you want to say?\" he asked.\\n\"Usul,\" she whispered, and still she trembled.\\n\"You cannot back into the future,\" he said.\\nA profound compassion for her swept through him. He pulled her against him,\\nstroked her head. \"Chani, Chani, don\\'t fear.\"\\n\"Usul, help me,\" she cried.\\nAs she spoke, he felt the drug complete its work within him, ripping away\\nthe curtains to let him see the distant gray turmoil of his future.\\n\"You\\'re so quiet,\" Chani said.\\nHe held himself poised in the awareness, seeing time stretch out in its\\nweird dimension, delicately balanced yet whirling, narrow yet spread like a net\\ngathering countless worlds and forces, a tightwire that he must walk, yet a\\nteeter-totter on which he balanced.\\nOn one side he could see the Imperium, a Harkonnen called Feyd-Rautha who\\nflashed toward him like a deadly blade, the Sardaukar raging off their planet to\\nspread pogrom on Arrakis, the Guild conniving and plotting, the Bene Gesserit\\nwith their scheme of selective breeding. They lay massed like a thunderhead on\\nhis horizon, held back by no more than the Fremen and their Muad\\'Dib, the\\nsleeping giant Fremen poised for their wild crusade across the universe.\\nPaul felt himself at the center, at the pivot where the whole structure\\nturned, walking a thin wire of peace with a measure of happiness, Chani at his\\n\\n\\x0cside. He could see it stretching ahead of him, a time of relative quiet in a\\nhidden sietch, a moment of peace between periods of violence.\\n\"There\\'s no other place for peace,\" he said.\\n\"Usul, you\\'re crying,\" Chani murmured. \"Usul, my strength, do you give\\nmoisture to the dead? To whose dead?\"\\n\"To ones not yet dead,\" he said.\\n\"Then let them have their time of life,\" she said.\\nHe sensed through the drug fog how right she was, pulled her against him\\nwith savage pressure. \"Sihaya!\" he said.\\nShe put a palm against his cheek, \"I\\'m no longer afraid, Usul. Look at me. I\\nsee what you see when you hold me thus.\"\\n\"What do you see?\" he demanded.\\n\"I see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It\\'s\\nwhat we were meant to do.\"\\nThe drug had him again and he thought: So many times you\\'ve given me comfort\\nand forgetfulness. He felt anew the hyperillumination with its high-relief\\nimagery of time, sensed his future becoming memories--the tender indignities of\\nphysical love, the sharing and communion of selves, the softness and the\\nviolence.\\n\"You\\'re the strong one, Chani,\" he muttered. \"Stay with me. \"\\n\"Always,\" she said, and kissed his cheek.\\n', 39: '\\nBook Three\\nTHE PROPHET\\n', 40: '\\nNo woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father. The closest\\nanyone ever came to casual camaraderie with the Padishah Emperor was the\\nrelationship offered by Count Hasimir Fenring, a companion from childhood. The\\nmeasure of Count Fenring\\'s friendship may be seen first in a positive thing: he\\nallayed the Landsraad\\'s suspicions after the Arrakis Affair. It cost more than a\\nbillion solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were other gifts\\nas well: slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank. The second major\\nevidence of the Count\\'s friendship was negative. He refused to kill a man even\\nthough it was within his capabilities and my father commanded it. I will relate\\nthis presently.\\n-\"Count Fenring: A Profile\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen raged down the corridor from his private\\napartments, flitting through patches of late afternoon sunlight that poured down\\nfrom high windows. He bobbed and twisted in his suspensors with violent\\nmovements.\\nPast the private kitchen he stormed -- past the library, past the small\\nreception room and into the servants\\' antechamber where the evening relaxation\\nalready had set in.\\nThe guard captain, Iakin Nefud, squatted on a divan across the chamber, the\\nstupor of semuta dullness in his flat face, the eerie wailing of semuta music\\naround him. His own court sat near to do his bidding.\\n\"Nefud!\" the Baron roared.\\nMen scrambled.\\nNefud stood, his face composed by the narcotic but with an overlay of\\npaleness that told of his fear. The semuta music had stopped.\\n\"My Lord Baron,\" Nefud said. Only the drug kept the trembling out of his\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Baron scanned the faces around him, seeing the looks of frantic quiet in\\nthem. He returned his attention to Nefud, and spoke in a silken tone:\\n\"How long have you been my guard captain, Nefud?\"\\nNefud swallowed. \"Since Arrakis, my Lord. Almost two years.\"\\n\"And have you always anticipated dangers to my person?\"\\n\"Such has been my only desire, my Lord.\"\\n\"Then where is Feyd-Rautha?\" the Baron roared.\\nNefud recoiled. \"M\\'Lord?\"\\n\"You do not consider Feyd-Rautha a danger to my person?\" Again, the voice\\nwas silken.\\nNefud wet his lips with his tongue. Some of the semuta dullness left his\\neyes. \"Feyd-Rautha\\'s in the slave quarters, my Lord.\"\\n\"With the women again, eh?\" The Baron trembled with the effort of\\nsuppressing anger.\\n\"Sire, it could be he\\'s --\"\\n\"Silence!\"\\nThe Baron advanced another step into the antechamber, noting how the men\\nmoved back, clearing a subtle space around Nefud, dissociating themselves from\\nthe object of wrath.\\n\"Did I not command you to know precisely where the na-Baron was at all\\ntimes?\" the Baron asked. He moved a step closer. \"Did I not say to you that you\\nwere to know precisely what the na-Baron was saying at all times -- and to\\nwhom?\" Another step. \"Did I not say to you that you were to tell me whenever he\\nwent into the quarters of the slave women?\"\\nNefud swallowed. Perspiration stood out on his forehead.\\nThe Baron held his voice flat, almost devoid of emphasis: \"Did I not say\\nthese things to you?\"\\nNefud nodded.\\n\"And did I not say to that you were to check all slave boys sent to me and\\nthat you were to do this yourself . . . personally?\"\\nAgain, Nefud nodded.\\n\"Did you, perchance, not see the blemish on the thigh of the one sent me\\nthis evening?\" the Baron asked. \"Is it possible you --\"\\n\"Uncle.\"\\nThe Baron whirled, stared at Feyd-Rautha standing in the doorway. The\\npresence of his nephew here, now -- the look of hurry that the young man could\\nnot quite conceal -- all revealed much. Feyd-Rautha had his own spy system\\nfocused on the Baron.\\n\"There is a body in my chambers that I wish removed,\" the Baron said, and he\\nkept his hand at the projectile weapon beneath his robes, thankful that his\\nshield was the best.\\nFeyd-Rautha glanced at two guardsmen against the right wall, nodded. The two\\ndetached themselves, scurried out the door and down the hall toward the Baron\\'s\\napartments.\\nThose two, eh? the Baron thought. Ah, this young monster has much to learn\\nyet about conspiracy!\\n\"I presume you left matters peaceful in the slave quarters, Feyd,\" the Baron\\nsaid.\\n\"I\\'ve been playing cheops with the slavemaster,\" Feyd-Rautha said, and he\\nthought: What has gone wrong? The boy we sent to my uncle has obviously been\\nkilled. But he was perfect for the job. Even Hawat couldn\\'t have made a better\\nchoice. The boy was perfect!\\n\"Playing pyramid chess,\" the Baron said. \"How nice. Did you win?\"\\n\"I . . . ah, yes, Uncle.\" And Feyd-Rautha strove to contain his disquiet.\\nThe Baron snapped his fingers. \"Nefud, you wish to be restored to my good\\ngraces?\"\\n\"Sire, what have I done?\" Nefud quavered.\\n\\n\\x0c\"That\\'s unimportant now,\" the Baron said. \"Feyd has beaten the slavemaster\\nat cheops. Did you hear that?\"\\n\"Yes . . . Sire.\"\\n\"I wish you to take three men and go to the slavemaster,\" the Baron said.\\n\"Garrote the slavemaster. Bring his body to me when you\\'ve finished that I may\\nsee it was done properly. We cannot have such inept chess players in our\\nemploy.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha went pale, took a step forward. \"But, Uncle, I --\"\\n\"Later, Feyd,\" the Baron said, and waved a hand. \"Later.\"\\nThe two guards who had gone to the Baron\\'s quarters for the slave boy\\'s body\\nstaggered past the antechamber door with their load sagging between them, arms\\ntrailing. The Baron watched until they were out of sight.\\nNefud stepped up beside the Baron. \"You wish me to kill the slavemaster,\\nnow, my Lord?\"\\n\"Now,\" the Baron said. \"And when you\\'ve finished, add those two who just\\npassed to your list. I don\\'t like the way they carried that body. One should do\\nsuch things neatly. I\\'ll wish to see their carcasses, too.\"\\nNefud said, \"My Lord, is it anything that I\\'ve --\"\\n\"Do as your master has ordered,\" Feyd-Rautha said. And he thought: All I can\\nhope for now is to save my own skin.\\nGood! the Baron thought. He yet knows how to cut his losses. And the Baron\\nsmiled inwardly at himself, thinking: The lad knows, too, what will please me\\nand be most apt to stay my wrath from falling on him. He knows I must preserve\\nhim. Who else do I have who could take the reins I must leave someday? I have no\\nother as capable. But he must learn! And I must preserve myself while he\\'s\\nlearning.\\nNefud signaled men to assist him, led them out the door.\\n\"Would you accompany me to my chambers, Feyd?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"I am yours to command,\" Feyd-Rautha said. He bowed, thinking: I\\'m caught.\\n\"After you,\" the Baron said, and he gestured to the door.\\nFeyd-Rautha indicated his fear by only the barest hesitation. Have I failed\\nutterly? he asked himself. Will he slip a poisoned blade into my back . . .\\nslowly, through the shield? Does he have an alternative successor?\\nLet him experience this moment of terror, the Baron thought as he walked\\nalong behind his nephew. He will succeed me, but at a time of my choosing. I\\'ll\\nnot have him throwing away what I\\'ve built!\\nFeyd-Rautha tried not to walk too swiftly. He felt the skin crawling on his\\nback as though his body itself wondered when the blow could come. His muscles\\nalternately tensed and relaxed.\\n\"Have you heard the latest word from Arrakis?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"No, Uncle.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha forced himself not to look back. He turned down the hall out of\\nthe servants\\' wing.\\n\"They\\'ve a new prophet or religious leader of some kind among the Fremen,\"\\nthe Baron said. \"They call him Muad\\'Dib. Very funny, really. It means \\'the\\nMouse.\\' I\\'ve told Rabban to let them have their religion. It\\'ll keep them\\noccupied.\"\\n\"That\\'s very interesting, Uncle,\" Feyd-Rautha said. He turned into the\\nprivate corridor to his uncle\\'s quarters, wondering: Why does he talk about\\nreligion? Is it some subtle hint to me?\\n\"Yes, isn\\'t it?\" the Baron said.\\nThey came into the Baron\\'s apartments through the reception salon to the\\nbedchamber. Subtle signs of a struggle greeted them here -- a suspensor lamp\\ndisplaced, a bedcushion on the floor, a soother-reel spilled open across a\\nbedstand.\\n\\n\\x0c\"It was a clever plan,\" the Baron said. He kept his body shield tuned to\\nmaximum, stopped, facing his nephew. \"But not clever enough. Tell me, Feyd, why\\ndidn\\'t you strike me down yourself? You\\'ve had opportunity enough.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha found a suspensor chair, accomplished a mental shrug as he sat\\ndown in it without being asked.\\nI must be bold now, he thought.\\n\"You taught me that my own hands must remain clean,\" he said.\\n\"Ah, yes,\" the Baron said. \"When you face the Emperor, you must be able to\\nsay truthfully that you did not do the deed. The witch at the Emperor\\'s elbow\\nwill hear your words and know their truth or falsehood. Yes. I warned you about\\nthat.\"\\n\"Why haven\\'t you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\n\"With a Truthsayer at your side --\"\\n\"You know my tastes!\" the Baron snapped.\\nFeyd-Rautha studied his uncle, said: \"Still, one would be valuable for --\"\\n\"I trust them not!\" the Baron snarled. \"And stop trying to change the\\nsubject!\"\\nFeyd-Rautha spoke mildly; \"As you wish, Uncle.\"\\n\"I remember a time in the arena several years ago,\" the Baron said. \"It\\nseemed there that day a slave had been set to kill you. Is that truly how it\\nwas?\"\\n\"It\\'s been so long ago, Uncle. After all, I --\"\\n\"No evasions, please,\" the Baron said, and the tightness of his voice\\nexposed the rein on his anger.\\nFeyd-Rautha looked at his uncle, thinking: He knows, else he wouldn\\'t ask.\\n\"It was a sham, Uncle. I arranged it to discredit your slavemaster.\"\\n\"Very clever,\" the Baron said. \"Brave, too. That slave-gladiator almost took\\nyou, didn\\'t he?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"If you had finesse and subtlety to match such courage, you\\'d be truly\\nformidable.\" The Baron shook his head from side to side. And as he had done many\\ntimes since that terrible day on Arrakis, he found himself regretting the loss\\nof Piter, the Mentat. There\\'d been a man of delicate, devilish subtlety. It\\nhadn\\'t saved him, though. Again, the Baron shook his head. Fate was sometimes\\ninscrutable.\\nFeyd-Rautha glanced around the bedchamber, studying the signs of the\\nstruggle, wondering how his uncle had overcome the slave they\\'d prepared so\\ncarefully.\\n\"How did I best him?\" the Baron asked. \"Ah-h-h, now, Feyd -- let me keep\\nsome weapons to preserve me in my old age. It\\'s better we use this time to\\nstrike a bargain.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha stared at him. A bargain! He means to keep me as his heir for\\ncertain, then. Else why bargain. One bargains with equals or near equals!\\n\"What bargain, Uncle?\" And Feyd-Rautha felt proud that his voice remained\\ncalm and reasonable, betraying none of the elation that filled him.\\nThe Baron, too, noted the control. He nodded. \"You\\'re good material, Feyd. I\\ndon\\'t waste good material. You persist, however, in refusing to learn my true\\nvalue to you. You are obstinate. You do not see why I should be preserved as\\nsomeone of the utmost value to you. This . . . \" He gestured at the evidence of\\nthe struggle in the bedchamber. \"This was foolishness. I do not reward\\nfoolishness.\"\\nGet to the point, you old fool! Feyd-Rautha thought.\\n\"You think of me as an old fool,\" the Baron said. \"I must dissuade you of\\nthat.\"\\n\"You speak of a bargain.\"\\n\"Ah, the impatience of youth,\" the Baron said. \"Well, this is the substance\\nof it, then: You will cease these foolish attempts on my life. And I, when you\\n\\n\\x0care ready for it, will step aside in your favor. I will retire to an advisory\\nposition, leaving you in the seat of power.\"\\n\"Retire, Uncle?\"\\n\"You still think me the fool,\" the Baron said, \"and this but confirms it,\\neh? You think I\\'m begging you! Step cautiously, Feyd. This old fool saw through\\nthe shielded needle you\\'d planted in that slave boy\\'s thigh. Right where I\\'d put\\nmy hand on it, eh? The smallest pressure and -- snick! A poison needle in the\\nold fool\\'s palm! Ah-h-h, Feyd . . . \"\\nThe Baron shook his head, thinking: It would\\'ve worked, too, if Hawat hadn\\'t\\nwarned me. Well, let the lad believe I saw the plot on my own. In a way, I did.\\nI was the one who saved Hawat from the wreckage of Arrakis. And this lad needs\\ngreater respect for my prowess.\\nFeyd-Rautha remained silent, struggling, with himself. Is he being truthful?\\nDoes he really mean to retire? Why not? I\\'m sure to succeed him one day if I\\nmove carefully. He can\\'t live forever. Perhaps it was foolish to try hurrying\\nthe process.\\n\"You speak of a bargain,\" Feyd-Rautha said. \"What pledge do we give to bind\\nit?\"\\n\"How can we trust each other, eh?\" the Baron asked. \"Well, Feyd, as for you:\\nI\\'m setting Thufir Hawat to watch over you. I trust Hawat\\'s Mentat capabilities\\nin this. Do you understand me? And as for me, you\\'ll have to take me on faith.\\nBut I can\\'t live forever, can I, Feyd? And perhaps you should begin to suspect\\nnow that there\\'re things I know which you should know.\"\\n\"I give you my pledge and what do you give me?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\n\"I let you go on living,\" the Baron said.\\nAgain, Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle. He sets Hawat over me! What would he\\nsay if I told him Hawat planned the trick with the gladiator that cost him his\\nslavemaster? He\\'d likely say I was lying in the attempt to discredit Hawat. No,\\nthe good Thufir is a Mentat and has anticipated this moment.\\n\"Well, what do you say?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"What can I say? I accept, of course.\"\\nAnd Feyd-Rautha thought: Hawat! He plays both ends against the middle . . .\\nis that it? Has he moved to my uncle\\'s camp because I didn\\'t counsel with him\\nover the slave boy attempt?\\n\"You haven\\'t said anything about my setting Hawat to watch you,\" the Baron\\nsaid.\\nFeyd-Rautha betrayed anger by a flaring of nostrils. The name of Hawat had\\nbeen a danger signal in the Harkonnen family for so many years . . . and now it\\nhad a new meaning: still dangerous.\\n\"Hawat\\'s a dangerous toy,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\\n\"Toy! Don\\'t be stupid. I know what I have in Hawat and how to control it.\\nHawat has deep emotions, Feyd. The man without emotions is the one to fear. But\\ndeep emotions . . . ah, now, those can be bent to your needs.\"\\n\"Uncle, I don\\'t understand you.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s plain enough.\"\\nOnly a flicker of eyelids betrayed the passage of resentment through FeydRautha.\\n\"And you do not understand Hawat,\" the Baron said.\\nNor do you! Feyd-Rautha thought.\\n\"Who does Hawat blame for his present circumstances?\" the Baron asked. \"Me?\\nCertainly. But he was an Atreides tool and bested me for years until the\\nImperium took a hand. That\\'s how he sees it. His hate for me is a casual thing\\nnow. He believes he can best me any time. Believing this, he is bested. For I\\ndirect his attention where I want it -- against the Imperium.\"\\nTensions of a new understanding drew tight lines across Feyd-Rautha\\'s\\nforehead, thinned his mouth. \"Against the Emperor?\"\\n\\n\\x0cLet my dear nephew try the taste of that, the Baron thought. Let him say to\\nhimself: \"The Emperor Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen!\" Let him ask himself how much\\nthat\\'s worth. Surely it must be worth the life of one old uncle who could make\\nthat dream come to pass!\\nSlowly, Feyd-Rautha wet his lips with his tongue. Could it be true what the\\nold fool was saying? There was more here than there seemed to be.\\n\"And what has Hawat to do with this?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\n\"He thinks he uses us to wreak his revenge upon the Emperor.\"\\n\"And when that\\'s accomplished?\"\\n\"He does not think beyond his revenge. Hawat\\'s a man who must serve others,\\nand doesn\\'t even know this about himself.\"\\n\"I\\'ve learned much from Hawat,\" Feyd-Rautha agreed, and felt the truth of\\nthe words as he spoke them. \"But the more I learn, the more I feel we should\\ndispose of him . . . and soon.\"\\n\"You don\\'t like the idea of his watching you?\"\\n\"Hawat watches everybody.\"\\n\"And he may put you on a throne. Hawat is subtle. He is dangerous, devious.\\nBut I\\'ll not yet withhold the antidote from him. A sword is dangerous, too,\\nFeyd. We have the scabbard for this one, though. The poison\\'s in him. When we\\nwithdraw the antidote, death will sheathe him.\"\\n\"In a way, it\\'s like the arena,\" Feyd-Rautha said. \"Feints within feints\\nwithin feints. You watch to see which way the gladiator leans, which way he\\nlooks, how he holds his knife.\"\\nHe nodded to himself, seeing that these words pleased his uncle, but\\nthinking: Yes! Like the arena! And the cutting edge is the mind!\\n\"Now you see how you need me,\" the Baron said. \"I\\'m yet of use, Feyd.\"\\nA sword to be wielded until he\\'s too blunt for use, Feyd-Rautha thought.\\n\"Yes, Uncle, \"he said.\\n\"And now,\" the Baron said, \"we will go down to the slave quarters, we two.\\nAnd I will watch while you, with your own hands, kill all the women in the\\npleasure wing.\"\\n\"Uncle!\"\\n\"There will be other women, Feyd. But I have said that you do not make a\\nmistake casually with me.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha\\'s face darkened. \"Uncle, you --\"\\n\"You will accept your punishment and learn something from it,\" the Baron\\nsaid.\\nFeyd-Rautha met the gloating stare in his uncle\\'s eyes. And I must remember\\nthis night, he thought. And remembering it, I must remember other nights.\\n\"You will not refuse,\" the Baron said.\\nWhat could you do if I refused, old man? Feyd-Rautha asked himself. But he\\nknew there might be some other punishment, perhaps a more subtle one, a more\\nbrutal lever to bend him.\\n\"I know you, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"You will not refuse.\"\\nAll right, Feyd-Rautha thought. I need you now. I see that. The bargain\\'s\\nmade. But I\\'ll not always need you. And . . . someday . . .\\n', 41: '\\nDeep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that\\nmakes sense.

He leaned back in\\nhis suspensor chair, the eyes in their folds of fat boring into Hawat.\\n\\n\\x0cThe old Mentat looked down at the table between him and the Baron Vladimir\\nHarkonnen, noting the opulence of its grain. Even this was a factor to consider\\nin assessing the Baron, as were the red walls of this private conference room\\nand the faint sweet herb scent that hung on the air, masking a deeper musk.\\n\"You didn\\'t have me send that warning to Rabban as an idle whim,\" the Baron\\nsaid.\\nHawat\\'s leathery old face remained impassive, betraying none of the loathing\\nhe felt. \"I suspect many things, my Lord,\" he said.\\n\"Yes. Well, I wish to know how Arrakis figures in your suspicions about\\nSalusa Secundus. It is not enough that you say to me the Emperor is in a ferment\\nabout some association between Arrakis and his mysterious prison planet. Now, I\\nrushed the warning out to Rabban only because the courier had to leave on that\\nHeighliner. You said there could be no delay. Well and good. But now I will have\\nan explanation.\"\\nHe babbles too much, Hawat thought. He\\'s not like Leto who could tell me a\\nthing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand. Nor like the Old Duke\\nwho could express an entire sentence in the way he accented a single word. This\\nis a clod! Destroying him will be a service to mankind.\\n\"You will not leave here until I\\'ve had a full and complete explanation,\"\\nthe Baron said.\\n\"You speak too casually of Salusa Secundus,\" Hawat said.\\n\"It\\'s a penal colony,\" the Baron said. \"The worst riff-raff in the galaxy\\nare sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to know?\"\\n\"That conditions on the prison planet are more oppressive than anywhere\\nelse,\" Hawat said. \"You hear that the mortality rate among new prisoners is\\nhigher than sixty per cent. You hear that the Emperor practices every form of\\noppression there. You hear all this and do not ask questions?\"\\n\"The Emperor doesn\\'t permit the Great Houses to inspect his prison,\" the\\nBaron growled. \"But he hasn\\'t seen into my dungeons, either.\"\\n\"And curiosity about Salusa Secundus is . . . ah . . . \" Hawat put a bony\\nfinger to his lips. \". . . discouraged.\"\\n\"So he\\'s not proud of some of the things he must do there!\"\\nHawat allowed the faintest of smiles to touch his dark lips. His eyes\\nglinted in the glowtube light as he stared at the Baron. \"And you\\'ve never\\nwondered where the Emperor gets his Sardaukar?\"\\nThe Baron pursed his fat lips. This gave his features the look of a pouting\\nbaby, and his voice carried a tone of petulance as he said: \"Why . . . he\\nrecruits . . . that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists from --\"\\n\"Faaa!\" Hawat snapped. \"The stories you hear about the exploits of the\\nSardaukar, they\\'re not rumors, are they? Those are first-hand accounts from the\\nlimited number of survivors who\\'ve fought against the Sardaukar, eh?\"\\n\"The Sardaukar are excellent fighting men, no doubt of it,\" the Baron said.\\n\"But I think my own legions --\"\\n\"A pack of holiday excursionists by comparison!\" Hawat snarled. \"You think I\\ndon\\'t know why the Emperor turned against House Atreides?\"\\n\"This is not a realm open to your speculation,\" the Baron warned.\\nIs it possible that even he doesn\\'t know what motivated the Emperor in this?\\nHawat asked himself.\\n\"Any area is open to my speculation if it does what you\\'ve hired me to do,\"\\nHawat said. \"I am a Mentat. You do not withhold information or computation lines\\nfrom a Mentat.\"\\nFor a long minute, the Baron stared at him, then: \"Say what you must say.\\nMentat.\"\\n\"The Padishah Emperor turned against House Atreides because the Duke\\'s\\nWarmasters Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho had trained a fighting force -- a\\nsmall fighting force -- to within a hair as good as the Sardaukar. Some of them\\n\\n\\x0cwere even better. And the Duke was in a position to enlarge his force, to make\\nit every bit as strong as the Emperor\\'s.\"\\nThe Baron weighed this disclosure, then: \"What has Arrakis to do with this?\"\\n\"It provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest\\nsurvival training.\"\\nThe Baron shook his head. \"You cannot mean the Fremen?\"\\n\"I mean the Fremen.\"\\n\"Hah! Then why warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen\\nleft after the Sardaukar pogrom and Rabban\\'s oppression.\"\\nHawat continued to stare at him silently.\\n\"Not more than a handful!\" the baron repeated. \"Rabban killed six thousand\\nof them last year alone!\"\\nStill, Hawat stared at him.\\n\"And the year before it was nine thousand,\" the baron said. \"And before they\\nleft, the Sardaukar must\\'ve accounted for at least twenty thousand.\"\\n\"What are Rabban\\'s troop losses for the past two years?\" Hawat asked.\\nThe Baron rubbed his jowls. \"Well, he has been recruiting rather heavily, to\\nbe sure. His agents make rather extravagant promises and --\"\\n\"Shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers?\" Hawat asked.\\n\"That would seem a little high,\" the baron said.\\n\"Quite the contrary,\" Hawat said. \"I can read between the lines of Rabban\\'s\\nreports as well as you can. And you certainly must\\'ve understood my reports from\\nour agents.\"\\n\"Arrakis is a fierce planet,\" the Baron said. \"Storm losses can --\"\\n\"We both know the figure for storm accretion,\" Hawat said.\\n\"What if he has lost thirty thousand?\" the Baron demanded, and blood\\ndarkened his face.\\n\"By your own count,\" Hawat said, \"he killed fifteen thousand over two years\\nwhile losing twice that number. You say the Sardaukar accounted for another\\ntwenty thousand, possibly a few more. And I\\'ve seen the transportation manifests\\nfor their return from Arrakis. If they killed twenty thousand, they lost almost\\nfive for one. Why won\\'t you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they\\nmean?\"\\nThe Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: \"This is your job, Mentat.\\nWhat do they mean?\"\\n\"I gave you Duncan Idaho\\'s head count on the sietch he visited,\" Hawat said.\\n\"It all fits. If they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities,\\ntheir population would be about five million. My best estimate is that they had\\nat least twice that many communities. You scatter your population on such a\\nplanet.\"\\n\"Ten million?\" The Baron\\'s jowls quivered with amazement.\\n\"At least.\"\\nThe Baron pursed his fat lips. The beady eyes stared without wavering at\\nHawat. Is this true Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this be and no\\none suspect?\\n\"We haven\\'t even cut heavily into their birth-rate-growth figure,\" Hawat\\nsaid. \"We\\'ve just weeded out some of their less successful specimens, leaving\\nthe strong to grow stronger -- just like on Salusa Secundus.\"\\n\"Salusa Secundus!\" the Baron barked. \"What has this to do with the Emperor\\'s\\nprison planet?\"\\n\"A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most\\nothers,\" Hawat said. \"When you add the very best of military training --\"\\n\"Nonsense! By your argument, I could recruit from among the Fremen after the\\nway they\\'ve been oppressed by my nephew.\"\\nHawat spoke in a mild voice: \"Don\\'t you oppress any of your troops?\"\\n\"Well . . . I . . . but --\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Oppression is a relative thing,\" Hawat said. \"Your fighting men are much\\nbetter off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant alternative to being\\nsoldiers of the Baron, heh?\"\\nThe Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities -- had Rabban\\nunwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon?\\nPresently he said: \"How could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits?\"\\n\"I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength,\" Hawat\\nsaid. \"I\\'d remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a\\ntraining cadre of people who understood their background, preferably people who\\nhad preceded them from the same oppressive situation. Then I\\'d fill them with\\nthe mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to\\nproduce just such superior beings as themselves. And all the while, I\\'d show\\nthem what such superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine\\nmansions . . . whatever they desired.\"\\nThe Baron began to nod. \"The way the Sardaukar live at home.\"\\n\"The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa Secundus\\nis justified because it produced them -- the elite. The commonest Sardaukar\\ntrooper lives a life, in many respects, as exalted as that of any member of a\\nGreat House.\"\\n\"Such an idea!\" the Baron whispered.\\n\"You begin to share my suspicions,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Where did such a thing start?\" the Baron asked.\\n\"Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa\\nSecundus before the Emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there? Even\\nthe Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions\\nare not encouraged.\"\\nThe Baron\\'s eyes glazed with thought. \"Yes, a very carefully kept secret.\\nThey\\'d use every device of --\"\\n\"Besides, what\\'s there to conceal?\" Hawat asked. \"That the Padishah Emperor\\nhas a prison planet? Everyone knows this. That he has --\"\\n\"Count Fenring!\" the Baron blurted.\\nHawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. \"What of Count\\nFenring?\"\\n\"At my nephew\\'s birthday several years ago,\" the Baron said. \"This Imperial\\npopinjay. Count Fenring, came as official observer and to . . . ah, conclude a\\nbusiness arrangement between the Emperor and myself.\"\\n\"So?\"\\n\"I . . . ah, during one of our conversations, I believe I said something\\nabout making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring --\"\\n\"What did you say exactly?\" Hawat asked.\\n\"Exactly? That was quite a while ago and --\"\\n\"My Lord Baron, if you wish to make the best use of my services, you must\\ngive me adequate information. Wasn\\'t this conversation recorded?\"\\nThe Baron\\'s face darkened with anger. \"You\\'re as bad as Piter! I don\\'t like\\nthese --\"\\n\"Piter is no longer with you my Lord,\" Hawat said. \"As to that, whatever did\\nhappen to Piter?\"\\n\"He became too familiar, too demanding of me,\" the Baron said.\\n\"You assure me you don\\'t waste a useful man,\" Hawat said. \"Will you waste me\\nby threats and quibbling? We were discussing what you said to Count Fenring.\"\\nSlowly, the Baron composed his features. When the time comes, he thought,\\nI\\'ll remember his manner with me. Yes. I will remember.\\n\"One moment,\" the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his\\ngreat hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood.\\n\"I said something like this,\" the Baron said. \"The Emperor knows a certain\\namount of killing has always been an arm of business.\\' I was referring to our\\nwork force losses. Then I said something about considering another solution to\\n\\n\\x0cthe Arrakeen problem and I said the Emperor\\'s prison planet inspired me to\\nemulate him.\"\\n\"Witch blood!\" Hawat snapped. \"What did Fenring say?\"\\n\"That\\'s when he began questioning me about you.\"\\nHawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. \"So that\\'s why they started\\nlooking into Arrakis,\" he said. \"Well, the thing\\'s done.\" He opened his eyes.\\n\"They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!\"\\n\"But certainly my innocent suggestion that --\"\\n\"Nothing is innocent in an Emperor\\'s eyes! What were your instructions to\\nRabban?\"\\n\"Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.\"\\nHawat shook his head. \"You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill\\noff the natives, wipe them out entirely, or --\"\\n\"Waste an entire work force?\"\\n\"Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still\\nswing behind him come in here and perform a curettement, scrape out Giedi Prime\\nlike a hollow gourd?\"\\nThe Baron studied his Mentat, then: \"He wouldn\\'t dare!\"\\n\"Wouldn\\'t he?\"\\nThe Baron\\'s lips quivered. \"What is your alternative?\"\\n\"Abandon your dear nephew, Rabban.\"\\n\"Aband . . . \" The Baron broke off, stared at Hawat.\\n\"Send him no more troops, no aid of any kind. Don\\'t answer his messages\\nother than to say you\\'ve heard of the terrible way he\\'s handled things on\\nArrakis and you intend to take corrective measures as soon as you\\'re able. I\\'ll\\narrange to have some of your messages intercepted by Imperial spies.\"\\n\"But what of the spice, the revenues, the --\"\\n\"Demand your baronial profits, but be careful how you make your demands.\\nRequire fixed sums of Rabban. We can --\"\\nThe Baron turned his hands palms up. \"But how can I be certain that my\\nweasel nephew isn\\'t --\"\\n\"We still have our spies on Arrakis. Tell Rabban he either meets the spice\\nquotas you set him or he\\'ll be replaced.\"\\n\"I know my nephew,\" the Baron said. \"This would only make him oppress the\\npopulation even more.\"\\n\"Of course he will!\" Hawat snapped. \"You don\\'t want that stopped now! You\\nmerely want your own hands clean. Let Rabban make your Salusa Secundus for you.\\nThere\\'s no need even to send him any prisoners. He has all the population\\nrequired. If Rabban is driving his people to meet your spice quotas, then the\\nEmperor need suspect no other motive. That\\'s reason enough for putting the\\nplanet on the rack. And you, Baron, will not show by word or action that there\\'s\\nany other reason for this.\"\\nThe Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice. \"Ah,\\nHawat, you are a devious one. Now, how do we move into Arrakis and make use of\\nwhat Rabban prepares?\"\\n\"That\\'s the simplest thing of all, Baron. If you set each year\\'s quota a bit\\nhigher than the one before, matters will soon reach a head there. Production\\nwill drop off. You can remove Rabban and take over yourself . . . to correct the\\nmess.\"\\n\"It fits,\" the Baron said. \"But I can feel myself tiring of all this. I\\'m\\npreparing another to take over Arrakis for me.\"\\nHawat studied the fat round face across from him. Slowly the old soldier-spy\\nbegan to nod his head. \"Feyd-Rautha,\" he said. \"So that\\'s the reason for the\\noppression now. You\\'re very devious yourself, Baron. Perhaps we can incorporate\\nthese two schemes. Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can go to Arrakis as their savior. He\\ncan win the populace. Yes.\"\\n\\n\\x0cThe Baron smiled. And behind his smile, he asked himself: Now, how does this\\nfit in with Hawat\\'s personal scheming?\\nAnd Hawat, seeing that he was dismissed, arose and left the red-walled room.\\nAs he walked, he could not put down the disturbing unknowns that cropped into\\nevery computation about Arrakis. This new religious leader that Gurney Halleck\\nhinted at from his hiding place among the smugglers, this Muad\\'Dib.\\nPerhaps I should not have told the Baron to let this religion flourish where\\nit will, even among the folk of pan and graben, he told himself. But it\\'s well\\nknown that repression makes a religion flourish.\\nAnd he thought about Halleck\\'s reports on Fremen battle tactics. The tactics\\nsmacked of Halleck himself . . . and Idaho . . . and even of Hawat.\\nDid Idaho survive? he asked himself.\\nBut this was a futile question. He did not yet ask himself if it was\\npossible that Paul had survived. He knew the Baron was convinced that all\\nAtreides were dead. The Bene Gesserit witch had been his weapon, the Baron\\nadmitted. And that could only mean an end to all -- even to the woman\\'s own son.\\nWhat a poisonous hate she must\\'ve had for the Atreides, he thought.\\nSomething like the hate I hold for this Baron. Will my blow be as final and\\ncomplete as hers?\\n', 42: '\\nThere is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry,\\nelegance, and grace -- those qualities you find always in that which the true\\nartist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand\\ntrails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern\\nof its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society,\\nseeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to\\nsee peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate\\npattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward\\ndeath.\\n-from \"The Collected Sayings of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nPaul-Muad\\'Dib remembered that there had been a meal heavy with spice\\nessence. He clung to this memory because it was an anchor point and he could\\ntell himself from this vantage that his immediate experience must be a dream.\\nI am a theater of processes, he told himself. I am a prey to the imperfect\\nvision, to the race consciousness and its terrible purpose.\\nYet, he could not escape the fear that he had somehow overrun himself, lost\\nhis position in time, so that past and future and present mingled without\\ndistinction. It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the\\nconstant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was\\nin itself a thing intrinsically of the past.\\nChani prepared the meal for me, he told himself.\\nYet Chani was deep in the south -- in the cold country where the sun was hot\\n-- secreted in one of the new sietch strongholds, safe with their son, Leto II.\\nOr, was that a thing yet to happen?\\nNo, he reassured himself, for Alia-the-Strange-One, his sister, had gone\\nthere with his mother and with Chani -- a twenty-thumper trip into the south,\\nriding a Reverend Mother\\'s palanquin fixed to the back of a wild maker.\\nHe shied away from thought of riding the giant worms, asking himself: Or is\\nAlia yet to be born?\\nI was on razzia, Paul recalled. We went raiding to recover the water of our\\ndead in Arrakeen. And I found the remains of my father in the funeral pyre. I\\nenshrined the skull of my father in a Fremen rock mound overlooking Harg Pass.\\nOr was that a thing yet to be?\\n\\n\\x0cMy wounds are real, Paul told himself. My scars are real. The shrine of my\\nfather\\'s skull is real.\\nStill in the dreamlike state, Paul remembered that Harah, Jamis\\' wife, had\\nintruded on him once to say there\\'d been a fight in the sietch corridor. That\\nhad been the interim sietch before the women and children had been sent into the\\ndeep south. Harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner chamber, the\\nblack wings of her hair tied back by water rings on a chain. She had held aside\\nthe chamber\\'s hangings and told him that Chani had just killed someone.\\nThis happened, Paul told himself. This was real, not born out of its time\\nand subject to change.\\nPaul remembered he had rushed out to find Chani standing beneath the yellow\\nglobes of the corridor, clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe with hood\\nthrown back, a flush of exertion on her elfin features. She had been sheathing\\nher crysknife. A huddled group had been hurrying away down the corridor with a\\nburden.\\nAnd Paul remembered telling himself: You always know when they\\'re carrying a\\nbody.\\nChani\\'s water rings, worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck,\\ntinkled as she turned toward him.\\n\"Chani, what is this?\" he asked.\\n\"I dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat, Usul.\"\\n\"You killed him?\"\\n\"Yes. But perhaps I should\\'ve left him for Harah.\"\\n(And Paul recalled how the faces of the people around them had showed\\nappreciation for these words. Even Harah had laughed.)\\n\"But he came to challenge me!\"\\n\"You trained me yourself in the weirding way, Usul.\"\\n\"Certainly! But you shouldn\\'t --\"\\n\"I was born in the desert, Usul. I know how to use a crysknife.\"\\nHe suppressed his anger, tried to talk reasonably. \"This may all be true,\\nChani, but --\"\\n\"I am no longer a child hunting scorpions in the sietch by the light of a\\nhandglobe, Usul. I do not play games.\"\\nPaul glared at her, caught by the odd ferocity beneath her casual attitude.\\n\"He was not worthy, Usul,\" Chani said. \"I\\'d not disturb your meditations\\nwith the likes of him.\" She moved closer, looking at him out of the corners of\\nher eyes, dropping her voice so that only he might hear. \"And, beloved, when\\nit\\'s learned that a challenger may face me and be brought to shameful death by\\nMuad\\'Dib\\'s woman, there\\'ll be fewer challengers.\"\\nYes, Paul told himself, that had certainly happened. It was true-past. And\\nthe number of challengers testing the new blade of Muad\\'Dib did drop\\ndramatically.\\nSomewhere, in a world not-of-the-dream, there was a hint of motion, the cry\\nof a nightbird.\\nI dream, Paul reassured himself. It\\'s the spice meal.\\nStill, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered it if might\\nbe possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world where\\nthe Fremen believed he had his true existence -- into the alam al-mithal, the\\nworld of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations\\nwere removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal\\nof all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In the landscape of\\na myth he could not orient himself and say: \"I am I because I am here.\"\\nHis mother had said once: \"The people are divided, some of them, in how they\\nthink of you.\"\\nI must be waking from the dream, Paul told himself. For this had happened -these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of\\nthe Fremen, these words had passed through reality.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the\\nFremen, Paul knew. She didn\\'t like the fact that people of both sietch and\\ngraben referred to Muad\\'Dib as Him. And she went questioning among the tribes,\\nsending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.\\nShe had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: \"When religion and politics\\ntravel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way.\\nTheir movement become headlong -- faster and faster and faster. They put aside\\nall thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the\\nman in a blind rush until it\\'s too late.\"\\nPaul recalled that he had sat there in his mother\\'s quarters, in the inner\\nchamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns\\nout of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her out, noting the way she\\nwas always observing -- even when her eyes were lowered. Her oval face had new\\nlines in it at the corners of the mouth, but the hair was still like polished\\nbronze. The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their over-casting of\\nspice-imbued blue.\\n\"The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,\" he said.\\n\"Nothing about religion is simple,\" she warned.\\nBut Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself\\nswayed by anger. He could only say: \"Religion unifies our forces. It\\'s our\\nmystique.\"\\n\"You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,\" she charged. \"You never\\ncease indoctrinating.\"\\n\"Thus you yourself taught me,\" he said.\\nBut she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been the\\nday of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had understood some of\\nthe reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his liaison -- the \"marriage\\nof youth\" -- with Chani. But Chani had produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had\\nfound herself unable to reject the child with the mother.\\nJessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: \"You think me an\\nunnatural mother.\"\\n\"Of course not.\"\\n\"I see the way you watch me when I\\'m with your sister. You don\\'t understand\\nabout your sister.\"\\n\"I know why Alia is different,\" he said. \"She was unborn, part of you, when\\nyou changed the Water of Life. She --\"\\n\"You know nothing of it!\"\\nAnd Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time,\\nsaid only: \"I don\\'t think you unnatural.\"\\nShe saw his distress, said: \"There is a thing, Son.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"I do love your Chani. I accept her.\"\\nThis was real, Paul told himself. This wasn\\'t the imperfect vision to be\\nchanged by the twistings out of time\\'s own birth.\\nThe reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality\\nbegan to dip through the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly that\\nhe was in a hiereg, a desert camp. Chani had planted their stilltent on flour-sand for its softness. That could only mean Chani was near by -- Chani, his\\nsoul, Chani his Sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries\\nof the deep south.\\nNow, he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep.\\n\"O my soul,\\nHave no taste for Paradise this night,\\nAnd I swear by Shai-hulud\\nYou will go there,\\nObedient to my love.\"\\n\\n\\x0cAnd she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm like\\nthe drag of the dunes against the feet:\\n\"Tell me of thine eyes\\nAnd I will tell thee of thy heart.\\nTell me of thy feet\\nAnd I will tell thee of thy hands.\\nTell me of thy sleeping\\nAnd I will tell thee of thy waking.\\nTell me of thy desires\\nAnd I will tell thee of thy need.\"\\nHe had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent. And he\\'d thought\\nthen of Gurney Halleck. Reminded by the familiar instrument, he had thought of\\nGurney whose face he had seen in a smuggler band, but who had not seen him,\\ncould not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the Harkonnens to\\nthe son of the Duke they had killed.\\nBut the style of the player in the night, the distinctiveness of the fingers\\non the baliset\\'s strings, brought the real musician back to Paul\\'s memory. It\\nhad been Chatt the Leaper, captain of the Fedaykin, leader of the death\\ncommandos who guarded Muad\\'Dib.\\nWe are in the desert, Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond the\\nHarkonnen patrols. I am here to walk the sand, to lure a maker and mount him by\\nmy own cunning that I may be a Fremen entire.\\nHe felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the silence\\nsurrounding him.\\nIt was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the\\nday creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.\\n\"You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see and\\nknow you have no fear,\" Stilgar had said. \"Thus we turn our time around and set\\nourselves to sleep this night.\"\\nQuietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a slacked stillsuit around\\nhis body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So softly he moved, yet Chani heard\\nhim.\\nShe spoke from the tent\\'s gloom, another shadow there: \"It\\'s not yet full\\nlight, beloved.\"\\n\"Sihaya,\" he said, speaking with half a laugh in his voice.\\n\"You call me your desert spring,\" she said, \"but this day I\\'m thy goad. I am\\nthe Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed.\"\\nHe began tightening his stillsuit. \"You told me once the words of the Kitab\\nal-Ibar,\" he said. \"You told me: \\'Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and\\ntill it.\\' \"\\n\"I am the mother of thy firstborn,\" she agreed.\\nHe saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement, securing her\\nstillsuit for the open desert. \"You should get all the rest you can,\" she said.\\nHe recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: \"The\\nSayyadina of the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate.\"\\nShe slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. \"Today, I am\\nboth the watcher and the woman.\"\\n\"You should\\'ve left this duty to another,\" he said.\\n\"Waiting is bad enough at best,\" she said. \"I\\'d sooner be at thy side.\"\\nHe kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned and\\ncracked the seal of the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill not-quite-dryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn. With it came the\\nsmell of a pre-spice mass, the mass they had detected off to the northeast, and\\nthat told them there would be a maker near by.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and stretched\\nthe sleep from his muscles. A faint green-pearl luminescence etched the eastern\\nhorizon. The tents of his troop were small false dunes around him in the gloom.\\nHe saw movement off to the left -- the guard, and knew they had seen him.\\nThey knew the peril he faced this day. Each Fremen had faced it. They gave\\nhim this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself.\\nIt must be done today, he told himself.\\nHe thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom -- the old men\\nwho sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle, the old\\nmen who listened to him now in council and followed his plans, the men who\\nreturned to pay him that highest Fremen compliment: \"Your plan worked,\\nMuad\\'Dib.\"\\nYet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing that he\\nhad never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent\\nknowledge of this difference between them.\\nHe had not ridden the maker.\\nOh, he\\'d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had\\nnot made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the abilities of\\nothers. No true Fremen could permit this. Until he did this thing himself, even\\nthe great southlands -- the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg -- were\\ndenied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one\\nof the sick and wounded.\\nMemory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the\\nnight. He saw a strange parallel here -- if he mastered the maker, his rule was\\nstrengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this carried its own measure of\\ncommand. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great Unrest where all\\nthe universe seemed embroiled.\\nThe differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him -accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it in situ. Yet, when it was born, when\\nit came into the pressures of reality, the now had its own life and grew with\\nits own subtle differences. Terrible purpose remained. Race consciousness\\nremained. And over all loomed the jihad, bloody and wild.\\nChani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him\\nfrom the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.\\n\"Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul,\" she said.\\nHe saw that she was trying to distract him, ease his mind of tensions before\\nthe deadly test. It was growing lighter, and he noted that some of his Fedaykin\\nwere already striking their tents.\\n\"I\\'d rather you told me about the sietch and about our son,\" he said. \"Does\\nour Leto yet hold my mother in his palm?\"\\n\"It\\'s Alia he holds as well,\" she said. \"And he grows rapidly. He\\'ll be a\\nbig man.\"\\n\"What\\'s it like in the south?\" he asked.\\n\"When you ride the maker you\\'ll see for yourself,\" she said.\\n\"But I wish to see it first through your eyes.\"\\n\"It\\'s powerfully lonely,\" she said.\\nHe touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her\\nstillsuit cap. \"Why will you not talk about the sietch?\"\\n\"I have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It\\'s\\na place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are\\nweapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to\\ncollect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to\\nanchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are\\nchildren to train that the tribe\\'s strength may never be lost.\"\\n\"Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?\" he asked.\\n\"The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food.\\nSometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"My sister, Alia -- is she accepted yet by the people?\"\\nChani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight. Her eyes bored into him.\\n\"It\\'s a thing to be discussed another time, beloved.\"\\n\"Let us discuss it now.\"\\n\"You should conserve your energies for the test,\" she said.\\nHe saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal in\\nher voice. \"The unknown brings its own worries,\" he said.\\nPresently she nodded, said, \"There is yet . . . misunderstanding because of\\nAlia\\'s strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more than an\\ninfant talks . . . of things that only an adult should know. They do not\\nunderstand the . . . change in the womb that made Alia . . . different.\"\\n\"There is trouble?\" he asked. And he thought: I\\'ve seen visions of trouble\\nover Alia.\\nChani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise. \"Some of the women\\nbanded to appeal to the Reverend Mother. They demanded she exorcise the demon in\\nher daughter. They quoted the scripture: \\'Suffer not a witch to live among us.\\'\\n\"\\n\"And what did my mother say to them?\"\\n\"She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: \\'If Alia\\nincites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing\\nthe trouble.\\' And she tried to explain how the change had worked on Alia in the\\nwomb. But the women were angry because they had been embarrassed. They went away\\nmuttering.\"\\nThere will be trouble because of Alia, he thought.\\nA crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face, bringing\\nthe scent of the pre-spice mass. \"El Sayal, the rain of sand that brings the\\nmorning,\" he said.\\nHe looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the landscape\\nbeyond pity, the sand that was form absorbed in itself. Dry lightning streaked a\\ndark corner to the south -- sign that a storm had built up its static charge\\nthere. The roll of thunder boomed long after.\\n\"The voice that beautifies the land,\" Chani said.\\nMore of his men were stirring out of their tents. Guards were coming in from\\nthe rims. Everything around him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that\\nrequired no orders.\\n\"Give as few orders as possible,\" his father had told him . . . once . . .\\nlong ago. \"Once you\\'ve given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on\\nthat subject.\"\\nThe Fremen knew this rule instinctively.\\nThe troop\\'s watermaster began the morning chanty, adding to it now the call\\nfor the rite to initiate a sandrider.\\n\"The world is a carcass,\" the man chanted, his voice wailing across the\\ndunes. \"Who can turn away the Angel of Death? What Shai-hulud has decreed must\\nbe.\"\\nPaul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the\\ndeath chant of his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they\\nburied themselves into battle.\\nWill there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another\\nsoul? Paul asked himself. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add\\nanother stone and think on Muad\\'Dib who died in this place?\\nHe knew this was among the alternatives today, a fact along lines of the\\nfuture radiating from this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued\\nhim. The more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of\\nthe jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His entire\\nfuture was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm -- the violent nexus\\nbeyond which all was fog and clouds.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Stilgar approaches,\" Chani said. \"I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, I\\nmust be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the\\nChronicles.\" She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then\\nshe had herself under control. \"When this is past, I shall prepare thy breakfast\\nwith my own hands,\" she said. She turned away.\\nStilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, stirring up little dust\\npuddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed\\nstare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the lines of craggy\\ncheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock for all their movement.\\nThe man carried Paul\\'s banner on its staff -- the green and black banner\\nwith a water tube in the staff -- that already was a legend in the land. Half\\npridefully, Paul thought: I cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a\\nlegend. They will mark how I parted from Chani, how I greet Stilgar -- every\\nmove I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then it will\\nbe only legend and nothing to stop the jihad.\\nStilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his\\nsides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought how\\nhis own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice.\\n\"They denied us the Hajj,\" Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.\\nAs Chani had taught him, Paul responded: \"Who can deny a Fremen the right to\\nwalk or ride where he wills?\"\\n\"I am a Naib,\" Stilgar said, \"never to be taken alive. I am a leg of the\\ndeath tripod that will destroy our foes.\"\\nSilence settled over them.\\nPaul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar, the\\nway they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer. And he thought\\nof how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing, an entire\\npeople who had lived with rage and grief all of their days, never once\\nconsidering what might take the place of either -- except for a dream with which\\nLiet-Kynes had infused them before his death.\\n\"Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?\"\\nStilgar asked.\\n\"He is ever with us,\" the Fremen chanted.\\nStilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice.\\n\"Now, remember what I told you. Do it simply and directly -- nothing fancy.\\nAmong our people, we ride the maker at the age of twelve. You are more than six\\nyears beyond that age and not born to this life. You don\\'t have to impress\\nanyone with your courage. We know you are brave. All you must do is call the\\nmaker and ride him.\"\\n\"I will remember,\" Paul said.\\n\"See that you do. I\\'ll not have you shame my teaching.\"\\nStilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe. The\\nthing was pointed at one end, had a spring-wound clapper at the other end. \"I\\nprepared this thumper myself. It\\'s a good one. Take it.\"\\nPaul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.\\n\"Shishakli has your hooks,\" Stilgar said. \"He\\'ll hand them to you as you\\nstep out onto that dune over there.\" He pointed to his right. \"Call a big maker,\\nUsul. Show us the way.\"\\nPaul marked the tone of Stilgar\\'s voice -- half ritual and half that of a\\nworried friend.\\nIn that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took on\\nthe silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and\\ndryness even for Arrakis.\\n\"It is the time of the scalding day,\" Stilgar said, and now his voice was\\nentirely ritual. \"Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader of\\nmen.\"\\n\\n\\x0cPaul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply now\\nthat the dawn wind had died. He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated -a dirty tan slope with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving\\nout in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their\\ncamp.\\nOne robed figure remained in Paul\\'s path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the\\nFedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask.\\nShishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The shafts\\nwere about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end,\\nroughened at the other end for a firm grip.\\nPaul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.\\n\"They are my own hooks,\" Shishakli said in a husky voice. \"They never have\\nfailed.\"\\nPaul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and up\\nthe dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like a\\nflight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy ridge\\nwith only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a\\ngood dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the viewpoint\\nvantage.\\nStooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the\\nsand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming. Then he\\nhesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death necessities that\\nfaced him.\\nWhen he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the\\nsand, a giant worm -- a maker -- would hear and come to the drumming. With the\\nwhiplike hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker\\'s high curving back.\\nFor as long as a forward edge of a worm\\'s ring segment was held open by a hook,\\nopen to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior, the creature would\\nnot retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact, roll its gigantic body to\\nbring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible.\\nI am a sandrider, Paul told himself.\\nHe glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only to\\nshift those hooks down the curve of a maker\\'s immense side to make the creature\\nroll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it done. He had been\\nhelped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm\\ncould be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and\\na new maker must be summoned.\\nOnce he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland -- to rest and restore himself -- into the\\nsouth where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the\\nnew palmaries and sietch warrens.\\nHe lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker\\nsummoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it\\nwas equally unknown to this test.\\n\"You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,\" Stilgar had explained.\\n\"You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so\\nclose that it engulfs you.\"\\nWith abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper\\'s latch. The clapper began\\nrevolving and the summons drummed through the sand, a measured \"lump . . . lump\\n. . . lump . . . \"\\nHe straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar\\'s words: \"Judge\\nthe line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an unseen approach\\nto a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it before you see it.\"\\nAnd Chani\\'s words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him\\novercame her, filled his mind: \"When you take your stand along the maker\\'s path,\\nyou must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand. Hide beneath\\nyour cloak and become a little dune in your very essence.\"\\n\\n\\x0cSlowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had\\nbeen taught.\\nIt came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently he\\nsaw the faraway outline of the creature\\'s track against the dawnlight and\\nrealized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of one this\\nsize. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the rise of the\\nsandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain.\\nThis is nothing I have seen by vision or in life, Paul cautioned himself. He\\nhurried across the path of the thing to take his stand, caught up entirely by\\nthe rushing needs of this moment.\\n', 43: '\\n\"Control the coinage and the courts -- let the rabble have the rest.\" Thus the\\nPadishah Emperor advises you. And he tells you: \"If you want profits, you must\\nrule.\" There is truth in these words, but I ask myself: \"Who are the rabble and\\nwho are the ruled?\"\\n-Muad\\'Dib\\'s Secret Message to the Landsraad from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the\\nPrincess Irulan\\nA thought came unbidden to Jessica\\'s mind: Paul will be undergoing his\\nsandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but\\nit\\'s obvious.\\nAnd Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.\\nJessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the\\nnight\\'s classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had\\nenjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place\\nhad thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand,\\nmulticolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The\\nroom was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that\\nshe had come to associate with a sense of security.\\nYet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place.\\nIt was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.\\nA faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber.\\nJessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay\\'s. Her time was near.\\nAnd Jessica knew she\\'d see the baby soon enough -- a blue-eyed cherub brought to\\nthe Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would\\nbe at the celebration and would report on it.\\nIt was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn\\'t have\\nstarted a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave\\nraids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.\\nJessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and\\nthe dangers he faced -- the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen\\nraids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of\\naircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural\\ndangers of the desert -- makers and thirst and dust chasms.\\nShe thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in\\nthese sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they\\nendured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen\\nendured.\\nA dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup\\nupon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.\\nAn offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.\\nShe took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society\\nof our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an\\n\\n\\x0canonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? I could alter any poison now\\nbefore it did me harm, or course, but the donor doesn\\'t realize this.\\nShe drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents -- hot and\\ndelicious.\\nAnd she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her\\nprivacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift\\nand not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift -- with\\nonly a slight tinge of fear.\\nAnother element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had\\nthought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she\\nknew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from\\nthe subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people\\ncould never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they\\nhad not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could\\nnot understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single\\norganism.\\nAnd the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.\\nHas Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He\\'s capable,\\nbut accident can strike down even the most capable.\\nThe waiting.\\nIt\\'s the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the\\ndreariness of the waiting overcomes you.\\nThere was all manner of waiting in their lives.\\nMore than two years we\\'ve been here, she thought, and twice that number at\\nleast to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the\\nHarkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.\\n\"Reverend Mother?\"\\nThe voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other\\nwoman in Paul\\'s menage.\\n\"Yes, Harah.\"\\nThe hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch\\nsandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders.\\nHer black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an\\ninsect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were\\ndrawn into an intense frown.\\nBehind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.\\nSeeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia\\'s\\nresemblance to Paul at that age -- the same wide-eyed solemnity to her questing\\nlook, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle differences,\\ntoo, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child -little more than a toddler -- carried herself with a calmness and awareness\\nbeyond her years. Adults were shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of\\nwords between the sexes. Or they\\'d catch themselves listening to her half-lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover\\nin her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two-year-old\\nhad ever encountered.\\nHarah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.\\n\"Alia.\" Jessica motioned to her daughter.\\nThe child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her\\nmother\\'s hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had\\nshared since before Alia\\'s birth. It wasn\\'t a matter of shared thoughts -although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing\\nthe spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate awareness\\nof another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-sympatico that made\\nthem emotionally one.\\nIn the formal manner that befitted a member of her son\\'s household, Jessica\\nsaid: \"Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?\"\\n\\n\\x0cWith the same traditional formality, she said: \"Subakh un nar. I am well.\"\\nThe words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.\\nJessica sensed amusement from Alia.\\n\"My brother\\'s ghanima is annoyed with me,\" Alia said in her half-lisp.\\nJessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah -- ghanima. In the\\nsubtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant \"something acquired in battle\"\\nand with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its\\noriginal purpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.\\nHarah scowled at the child. \"Don\\'t try to insult me, child. I know my\\nplace.\"\\n\"What have you done this time, Alia?\" Jessica asked.\\nHarah answered; \"Not only has she refused to play with the other children\\ntoday, but she intruded where . . . \"\\n\"I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay\\'s child being born,\" Alia\\nsaid. \"It\\'s a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he\\'d cried long\\nenough --\"\\n\"She came out and touched him,\" Harah said, \"and he stopped crying. Everyone\\nknows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he\\'s in sietch because\\nhe can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr.\"\\n\"He\\'d cried enough,\" Alia said. \"I just wanted to feel his spark, his life.\\nThat\\'s all. And when he felt me he didn\\'t want to cry anymore.\"\\n\"It\\'s just made more talk among the people,\" Harah said.\\n\"Subiay\\'s boy is healthy?\" Jessica asked. She saw that something was\\ntroubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.\\n\"Healthy as any mother could ask,\" Harah said. \"They know Alia didn\\'t hurt\\nhim. They didn\\'t so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and\\nwas happy. It was . . . \" Harah shrugged.\\n\"It\\'s the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?\" Jessica asked. \"It\\'s the\\nway she speaks of things beyond her years and of things no child her age could\\nknow -- things of the past.\"\\n\"How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?\" Harah\\ndemanded.\\n\"But he does!\" Alia said, \"Subiay\\'s boy looks just like the son of Mitha\\nborn before the parting.\"\\n\"Alia!\" Jessica said. \"I warned you.\"\\n\"But, Mother, I saw it and it was true and . . . \"\\nJessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah\\'s face.\\nWhat have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth\\neverything that I knew . . . and more: everything revealed to her out of the\\ncorridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.\\n\"It\\'s not just the things she says,\" Harah said. \"It\\'s the exercises, too:\\nthe way she sits and stares at a rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose,\\nor a muscle on the back of a finger, or --\"\\n\"Those are the Bene Gesserit training,\" Jessica said. \"You know that, Harah.\\nWould you deny my daughter her inheritance?\"\\n\"Reverend Mother, you know these things don\\'t matter to me,\" Harah said.\\n\"It\\'s the people and the way they mutter. I feel danger in it. They say your\\ndaughter\\'s a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that she\\'s --\"\\n\"She has so little in common with the other children,\" Jessica said. \"She\\'s\\nno demon. It\\'s just the --\"\\n\"Of course she\\'s not!\"\\nJessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah\\'s tone, glanced\\ndown at Alia. The child appeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of . . .\\nwaiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.\\n\"I respect the fact that you\\'re a member of my son\\'s household,\" Jessica\\nsaid. (Alia stirred against her hand.) \"You may speak openly with me of\\nwhatever\\'s troubling you.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"I will not be a member of your son\\'s household much longer,\" Harah said.\\n\"I\\'ve waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they\\nreceive as the children of Usul. It\\'s little enough I could give them since it\\'s\\nknown I don\\'t share your son\\'s bed.\"\\nAgain Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.\\n\"You\\'d have made a good companion for my son, though,\" Jessica said. And she\\nadded to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion . . . not a\\nwife. Jessica\\'s thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came\\nfrom the common talk in the sietch that her son\\'s companionship with Chani had\\nbecome a permanent thing, the marriage.\\nI love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have\\nto step aside for royal necessity. Royal marriages had other reasons than love.\\n\"You think I don\\'t know what you plan for your son?\" Harah asked.\\n\"What do you mean?\" Jessica demanded.\\n\"You plan to unite the tribes under Him,\" Harah said.\\n\"Is that bad?\"\\n\"I see danger for him . . . and Alia is part of that danger.\"\\nAlia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.\\n\"I\\'ve watched you two together,\" Harah said, \"the way you touch. And Alia is\\nlike my own flesh because she\\'s sister to one who is like my brother. I\\'ve\\nwatched over her and guarded her from the time she was a mere baby, from the\\ntime of the razzia when we fled here. I\\'ve seen many things about her.\"\\nJessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.\\n\"You know what I mean,\" Harah said. \"The way she knew from the first what we\\nwere saying to her. When has there been another baby who knew the water\\ndiscipline so young? What other baby\\'s first words to her nurse were: \\'I love\\nyou, Harah\\'?\"\\nHarah stared at Alia. \"Why do you think I accept her insults? I know there\\'s\\nno malice in them.\"\\nAlia looked up at her mother.\\n\"Yes, I have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother,\" Harah said. \"I could have\\nbeen of the Sayyadina. I have seen what I have seen.\"\\n\"Harah . . . \" Jessica shrugged. \"I don\\'t know what to say.\" And she felt\\nsurprise at herself, because this literally was true.\\nAlia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting\\nended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.\\n\"We made a mistake,\" Alia said. \"Now we need Harah.\"\\n\"It was the ceremony of the seed,\" Harah said, \"when you changed the Water\\nof Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.\"\\nNeed Harah? Jessica asked herself.\\n\"Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?\"\\nAlia asked.\\n\"What would you have her do?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"She already knows what to do,\" Alia said.\\n\"I will tell them the truth,\" Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old and\\nsad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp\\nfeatures. \"I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that\\nshe has never been a little girl.\"\\nAlia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of\\nsadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.\\n\"I know I\\'m a freak,\" Alia whispered. The adult summation coming from the\\nchild mouth was like a bitter confirmation.\\n\"You\\'re not a freak!\" Harah snapped. \"Who dared say you\\'re a freak?\"\\nAgain, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah\\'s\\nvoice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly -- they did need Harah.\\nThe tribe would understand Harah -- both her words and her emotions -- for it\\nwas obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Who said it?\" Harah repeated.\\n\"Nobody.\"\\nAlia used a corner of Jessica\\'s aba to wipe the tears from her face. She\\nsmoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it.\\n\"Then don\\'t you say it,\" Harah ordered.\\n\"Yes, Harah.\"\\n\"Now,\" Harah said, \"you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell the\\nothers. Tell me what it is that happened to you.\"\\nAlia swallowed, looked up at her mother.\\nJessica nodded.\\n\"One day I woke up,\" Alia said. \"It was like waking from sleep except that I\\ncould not remember going to sleep. I was in a warm, dark place. And I was\\nfrightened.\"\\nListening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that\\nday in the big cavern.\\n\"When I was frightened,\" Alia said, \"I tried to escape, but there was no way\\nto escape. Then I saw a spark . . . but it wasn\\'t exactly like seeing it. The\\nspark was just there with me and I felt the spark\\'s emotions . . . soothing me,\\ncomforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was\\nmy mother.\"\\nHarah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a look\\nof wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too,\\nwere trying to hear Alia\\'s words.\\nAnd Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks . . .\\nout of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?\\n\"Just when I felt safe and reassured,\" Alia said, \"there, was another spark\\nwith us . . . and everything was happening at once. The other spark was the old\\nReverend Mother. She was . . . trading lives with my mother . . . everything . .\\n. and I was there with them, seeing it all . . . everything. And it was over,\\nand I was them and all the others and myself . . . only it took me a long time\\nto find myself again. There were so many others.\"\\n\"It was a cruel thing,\" Jessica said. \"No being should wake into\\nconsciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to\\nyou.\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t do anything else!\" Alia said. \"I didn\\'t know how to reject or\\nhide my consciousness . . . or shut if off . . . everything just happened . . .\\neverything . . . \"\\n\"We didn\\'t know,\" Harah murmured. \"When we gave your mother the Water to\\nchange, we didn\\'t know you existed within her.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be sad about it, Harah,\" Alia said. \"I shouldn\\'t feel sorry for\\nmyself. After all, there\\'s cause for happiness here: I\\'m a Reverend Mother. The\\ntribe has two Rev . . . \"\\nShe broke off, tipping her head to listen.\\nHarah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia,\\nbringing her attention then up to Jessica\\'s face.\\n\"Didn\\'t you suspect?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"Sh-h-h-h,\" Alia said.\\nA distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated\\nthem from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now:\\n\"Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!\"\\nThe chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to\\nthe inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.\\nWhen the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the\\nsadness in her voice: \"It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse.\"\\n\"My family sat in their pool courtyard,\" Harah said, \"in air bathed by the\\nmoisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree of portyguls,\\nround and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket with mish mish and\\n\\n\\x0cbaklawa and mugs of liban -- all manner of good things to eat. In our gardens\\nand, in our flocks, there was peace . . . peace in all the land.\"\\n\"Life was full with happiness until the raiders came,\" Alia said.\\n\"Blood ran cold at the scream of friends,\" Jessica said. And she felt the\\nmemories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.\\n\"La, la, la, the women cried,\" said Harah.\\n\"The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives\\ndripping red from the lives of our men,\" Jessica said.\\nSilence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the\\nsietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.\\nPresently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words\\na harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.\\n\"We will never forgive and we will never forget,\" Harah said.\\nIn the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of\\npeople, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the\\nhangings that shielded her chamber.\\n\"Reverend Mother?\"\\nA woman\\'s voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of\\nStilgar\\'s wives.\\n\"What is it, Tharthar?\"\\n\"There is trouble, Reverend Mother.\"\\nJessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. \"Paul . .\\n.\" she gasped.\\nTharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a\\npress of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at\\nTharthar -- a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue\\nof her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to\\nreveal the plug scars.\\n\"What is it?\" Jessica demanded.\\n\"There is word from the sand,\" Tharthar said. \"Usul meets the maker for his\\ntest . . . it is today. The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider\\nby nightfall. The young men are banding for a razzia. They will raid in the\\nnorth and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then. They say they\\nwill force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.\"\\nGathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely\\n-- these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The little raids, the certain\\nraids -- these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained them. They\\nfeel their power. They want to fight.\\nTharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.\\nWe know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but there\\'s the core\\nof our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do\\nus. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting\\'s prolonged.\\n\"The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be\\nafraid,\" Tharthar said.\\nShe lowered her gaze.\\n\"So that\\'s the way of it,\" Jessica muttered. And she thought: Well I saw it\\ncoming. As did Stilgar.\\nAgain, Tharthar cleared her throat. \"Even my brother, Shoab, says it,\" she\\nsaid. \"They will leave Usul no choice.\"\\nThen it has come, Jessica thought. And Paul will have to handle it himself.\\nThe Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.\\nAlia freed her hand from her mother\\'s, said: \"I will go with Tharthar and\\nlisten to the young men. Perhaps there is a way.\"\\nJessica met Tharthar\\'s gaze, but spoke to Alia: \"Go, then. And report to me\\nas soon as you can.\"\\n\"We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother,\" Tharthar said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"We do not want it,\" Jessica agreed. \"The tribe needs all its strength.\" She\\nglanced at Harah. \"Will you go with them?\"\\nHarah answered the unspoken part of the question: \"Tharthar will allow no\\nharm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to\\nshare the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and I.\" Harah looked up at\\nTharthar, back to Jessica. \"We have an understanding.\"\\nTharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: \"We must hurry. The young men are\\nleaving.\"\\nThey pressed through the hangings, the child\\'s hand in the small woman\\'s\\nhand, but the child seemed to be leading.\\n\"If Paul-Muad\\'Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe,\" Harah said.\\n\"Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed.\"\\n\"Times have changed for you, as well,\" Jessica said.\\n\"You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle,\" Harah said. \"Usul\\ncould not but win.\"\\n\"That was my meaning,\" Jessica said.\\n\"And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment,\" Harah said. She\\nshook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. \"How wrong you are.\\nPerhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of Usul, that I\\nam jealous of Chani?\"\\n\"You make your own choice as you are able,\" Jessica said.\\n\"I pity Chani,\" Harah said.\\nJessica stiffened. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\"I know what you think of Chani,\" Harah said. \"You think she is not the wife\\nfor your son.\"\\nJessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. \"Perhaps.\"\\n\"You could be right,\" Harah said. \"If you are, you may find a surprising\\nally -- Chani herself. She wants whatever is best for Him.\"\\nJessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. \"Chani\\'s very dear\\nto me,\" she said. \"She could be no --\"\\n\"Your rugs are very dirty in here,\" Harah said. She swept her gaze around\\nthe floor, avoiding Jessica\\'s eyes. \"So many people tramping through here all\\nthe time. You really should have them cleaned more often.\"\\n', 44: '\\nYou cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This\\npower struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the\\northodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community\\ninevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete\\nopportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing\\nthemselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.\\n-from \"Muad\\'Dib: The Religious Issues\" by the Princess Irulan\\nPaul waited on the sand outside the gigantic maker\\'s line of approach. I\\nmust not wait like a smuggler -- impatient and jittering, he reminded himself. I\\nmust be part of the desert.\\nThe thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the friction-hissing of its passage. Its great teeth within the cavern-circle of its mouth\\nspread like some enormous flower. The spice odor from it dominated the air.\\nPaul\\'s stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of\\nhis nose plugs, the breathing mask. Stilgar\\'s teaching, the painstaking hours on\\nthe sand, overshadowed all else.\\n\"How far outside the maker\\'s radius must you stand in pea sand?\" Stilgar had\\nasked him.\\nAnd he had answered correctly: \"Half a meter for every meter of the maker\\'s\\ndiameter.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Why?\"\\n\"To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount\\nit.\"\\n\"You\\'ve ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life,\"\\nStilgar had said. \"But what you\\'ll summon for your test is a wild maker, an old\\nman of the desert. You must have proper respect for such a one.\"\\nNow the thumper\\'s deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching\\nworm. Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness of sand even through his\\nfilters. The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed, almost on him. Its\\ncresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees.\\nCome up, you lovely monster, he thought. Up. You hear me calling. Come up.\\nCome up.\\nThe wave lifted his feet. Surface dust swept across him. He steadied\\nhimself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand-clouded curving wall,\\nthat segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.\\nPaul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in. He felt them bite and\\npull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against\\nthe clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted\\nthe hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the segment,\\nthe worm would not roll down and crush him.\\nThe worm slowed. It glided across the thumper, silencing it. Slowly, it\\nbegan to roll -- up, up -- bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible,\\naway from the sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.\\nPaul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like an\\nemperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to\\nturn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.\\nSuddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young men\\nwho danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their backs,\\nremoving both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them.\\nLeaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower down\\nthe side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first\\none, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as it rolled, it\\nturned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited.\\nPaul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the\\nsensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a triple line\\nbehind him, steadied against their hooks.\\nStilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul\\'s hooks,\\nglanced up at Paul\\'s smiling face.\\n\"You did it, eh?\" Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their\\npassage. \"That\\'s what you think? You did it?\" He straightened. \"Now I tell you\\nthat was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who do better. There was\\ndrumsand to your left where you waited. You could not retreat there if the worm\\nturned that way.\"\\nThe smile slipped from Paul\\'s face. \"I saw the drumsand.\"\\n\"Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to\\nyou? It was a thing you could do even in the test.\"\\nPaul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.\\n\"You think it bad of me to say this now,\" Stilgar said. \"It is my duty. I\\nthink of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the\\nmaker would\\'ve turned toward you.\"\\nIn spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth. It\\ntook a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his\\nmother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. \"I apologize,\" he said. \"It will\\nnot happen again.\"\\n\"In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take the\\nmaker if you cannot,\" Stilgar said. \"Remember that we work together. That way,\\nwe\\'re certain. We work together, eh?\"\\n\\n\\x0cHe slapped Paul\\'s shoulder.\\n\"We work together,\" Paul agreed.\\n\"Now,\" Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, \"show me you know how to\\nhandle a maker. Which side are we on?\"\\nPaul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the\\ncharacter and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right,\\nsmaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side\\nup more frequently. As it grew older, the characteristic up-side became an\\nalmost constant thing. Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales\\ncould be told by size alone on a big worm.\\nShifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to\\nopen segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it\\nrolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and\\ninto positions ahead.\\n\"Ach, haiiiii-yoh!\" he shouted in the traditional call. The left-side\\nsteersman opened a ring segment there.\\nIn a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment. Full\\naround it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: \"Geyrat!\"\\nThe steersman released his hook. The maker lined out in a straight course.\\nStilgar said. \"Very good, Paul Muad\\'Dib. With plenty of practice, you may\\nyet become a sandrider.\"\\nPaul frowned, thinking: Was I not first up?\\nFrom behind him there came sudden laughter. The troop began chanting,\\nflinging his name against the sky.\\n\"Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib!\"\\nAnd far to the rear along the worm\\'s surface, Paul heard the beat of the\\ngoaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed. Their robes\\nflapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage increased.\\nPaul looked back through the troop, found Chani\\'s face among them. He looked\\nat her as he spoke to Stilgar. \"Then I am a sandrider, Stil?\"\\n\"Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day.\"\\n\"Then I may choose our destination?\"\\n\"That\\'s the way of it.\"\\n\"And I am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erg. I have had no\\nlife before this day. I was as a child until this day.\"\\n\"Not quite a child,\" Stilgar said. He fastened a corner of his hood where\\nthe wind was whipping it.\\n\"But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been pulled.\"\\n\"There is no cork.\"\\n\"I would go south, Stilgar -- twenty thumpers. I would see this land we\\nmake, this land that I\\'ve only seen through the eyes of others.\"\\nAnd I would see my son and my family, he thought. I need time now to\\nconsider the future that is a past within my mind. The turmoil comes and if I\\'m\\nnot where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.\\nStilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze. Paul kept his attention\\non Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also the excitement\\nhis words had kindled in the troop.\\n\"The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"The sinks are only a thumper away.\"\\n\"The Fedaykin have raided with me,\" Paul said. \"They\\'ll raid with me again\\nuntil no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.\"\\nStilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing this\\nmoment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the Tabr sietch and\\nto leadership of the Council of Leaders now that Liet-Kynes was dead.\\nHe has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen, Paul thought.\\n\"Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?\" Stilgar asked.\\n\\n\\x0cEyes blazed among the young men of the troop. They swayed as they rode, and\\nthey watched. And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chani\\'s glance, the way she\\nlooked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul-Muad\\'Dib, who was her mate.\\n\"You cannot guess what I want,\" Paul said.\\nAnd he thought: I cannot back down. I must hold control over these people.\\n\"You are mudir of the sandride this day,\" Stilgar said. Cold formality rang\\nin his voice: \"How do you use this power?\"\\nWe need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thought.\\n\"We shall go south,\" Paul said.\\n\"Even if I say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?\"\\n\"We shall go south,\" Paul repeated.\\nA sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly\\naround him. \"There will be a Gathering,\" he said. \"I will send the messages.\"\\nHe thinks I will call him out, Paul thought. And he knows he cannot stand\\nagainst me.\\nPaul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of\\nthe necessities that went into his decisions.\\nThey do not know how it is, he thought.\\nBut he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him. He had to remain\\non the central line of the time storm he could see in the future. There would\\ncome an instant when it could be unraveled, but only if he were where he could\\ncut the central knot of it.\\nI will not call him out if it can be helped, he thought. If there\\'s another\\nway to prevent the jihad . . .\\n\"We\\'ll camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath\\nHabbanya Ridge,\" Stilgar said. He steadied himself with one hook against the\\nswaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the\\ndesert.\\nPaul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves. No\\ngreen, no blossom softened that rigid horizon. Beyond it stretched the way to\\nthe southern desert -- a course of at least ten days and nights, as fast as they\\ncould goad the makers.\\nTwenty thumpers.\\nThe way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols. He knew how it would be. The\\ndreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there \\'d be a faint change of color\\non the far horizon -- such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining\\nit out of his hopes -- and there would be the new sietch.\\n\"Does my decision suit Muad\\'Dib?\" Stilgar asked. Only the faintest touch of\\nsarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every tone in a\\nbird\\'s cry or a cielago\\'s piping message, heard the sarcasm and watched Paul to\\nsee what he would do.\\n\"Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the Fedaykin,\"\\nPaul said. \"My death commandos know I spoke with honor. Does Stilgar doubt it?\"\\nReal pain exposed itself in Paul\\'s voice. Stilgar heard it and lowered his\\ngaze.\\n\"Usul, the companion of my sietch, him I would never doubt,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"But you are Paul-Muad\\'Dib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the Lisan al-Gaib,\\nthe Voice from the Outer World. These men I don\\'t even know.\"\\nPaul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert. The\\nmaker beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry them almost\\ntwice the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He knew it. There was\\nnothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of\\nthe desert. It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized.\\nA hand gripped his shoulder.\\nPaul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it -- the dark eyes\\nof Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.\\n\\n\\x0c\"The one who led Tabr sietch before me,\" Stilgar said, \"he was my friend. We\\nshared dangers. He owed me his life many a time . . . and I owed him mine.\"\\n\"I am your friend, Stilgar,\" Paul said.\\n\"No man doubts it,\" Stilgar said. He removed his hand, shrugged. \"It\\'s the\\nway.\"\\nPaul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the\\npossibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of\\nhis predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in\\nthe desert. Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.\\n\"We should leave this maker in deep sand,\" Paul said.\\n\"Yes,\" Stilgar agreed. \"We could walk to the cave from here.\"\\n\"We\\'ve ridden him far enough that he\\'ll bury himself and sulk for a day or\\nso,\" Paul said.\\n\"You\\'re the mudir of the sandride,\" Stilgar said. \"Say when we . . .\" He\\nbroke off, stared at the eastern sky.\\nPaul whirled. The spice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark,\\na richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in\\nsharp contrast.\\nOrnithopter!\\n\"One small \\'thopter,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"Could be a scout,\" Paul said. \"Do you think they\\'ve seen us.\"\\n\"At this distance we\\'re just a worm on the surface,\" Stilgar said. He\\nmotioned with his left hand. \"Off. Scatter on the sand.\"\\nThe troop began working down the worm\\'s sides, dropping off, blending with\\nthe sand beneath their cloaks. Paul marked where Chani dropped. Presently, only\\nhe and Stilgar remained.\\n\"First up, last off,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand.\\nPaul waited until the maker was safely clear of the scatter area, then released\\nhis hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted.\\nFreed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the sand.\\nPaul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and\\nleaped off. He landed running, lunged against the slipface of a dune the way he\\nhad been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe.\\nNow, the waiting . . .\\nPaul turned, gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe. He\\nimagined the others back along their path doing the same.\\nHe heard the beat of the \\'thopter\\'s wings before he saw it. There was a\\nwhisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a broad arc\\ntoward the ridge.\\nAn unmarked \\'thopter, Paul noted.\\nIt flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge.\\nA bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.\\nPaul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top. Other figures\\nstood out in a line trailing away from the ridge. He recognized Chani and\\nStilgar among them.\\nStilgar signaled toward the ridge.\\nThey gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a broken\\nrhythm that would disturb no maker. Stilgar paced himself beside Paul along the\\nwindpacked crest of a dune.\\n\"It was a smuggler craft,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"So it seemed,\" Paul said. \"But this is deep into the desert, for\\nsmugglers.\"\\n\"They\\'ve their difficulties with patrols, too,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"If they come this deep, they may go deeper,\" Paul said.\\n\"True.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"It wouldn\\'t be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured\\ntoo deep into the south. Smugglers sell information, too.\"\\n\"They were hunting spice, don\\'t you think?\" Stilgar asked.\\n\"There will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one,\" Paul\\nsaid. \"We\\'ve spice. Let\\'s bait a patch of sand and catch us some smugglers. They\\nshould be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new\\nweapons.\"\\n\"Now, Usul speaks,\" Stilgar said. \"Usul thinks Fremen.\"\\nBut Usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose, Paul\\nthought.\\nAnd the storm was gathering.\\n', 45: '\\nWhen law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious,\\nfully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.\\n-from \"Muad\\'Dib: The Ninety-Nine Wonders of the Universe\" by Princess Irulan\\nThe smuggler\\'s spice factory with its parent carrier and ring of drone\\nornithopters came over a lifting of dunes like a swarm of insects following its\\nqueen. Ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the\\ndesert floor like small imitations of the Shield Wall. The dry beaches of the\\nridge were swept clean by a recent storm.\\nIn the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted\\nthe oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape. Beyond the ridge,\\nhe could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow, and he gave the signal to a\\nhovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate.\\nThe \\'thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal. It broke away\\nfrom the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the area with its\\ndetectors dangling close to the surface.\\nAlmost immediately, it went through the wing-tucked dip and circle that told\\nthe waiting factory that spice had been found.\\nGurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal. He\\nliked this spot. The ridge offered some shielding and protection. This was deep\\nin the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush . . . still . . . Gurney signaled\\nfor a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent reserves to take up station\\nin pattern around the area -- not too high because then they could be seen from\\nafar by Harkonnen detectors.\\nHe doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south. This was\\nstill Fremen country.\\nGurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless out\\nhere. Anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs. He rubbed\\nthe inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it would be safest\\nto lead a ground party through the ridge. Inspection on foot was still the most\\ncertain. You couldn\\'t be too careful when Fremen and Harkonnen were at each\\nother\\'s throats.\\nIt was Fremen that worried him here. They didn\\'t mind trading for all the\\nspice you could afford, but they were devils on the warpath if you stepped foot\\nwhere they forbade you to go. And they were so devilishly cunning of late.\\nIt annoyed Gurney, the cunning and adroitness in battle of these natives.\\nThey displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything he had ever\\nencountered, and he had been trained by the best fighters in the universe then\\nseasoned in battles where only the superior few survived.\\nAgain Gurney scanned the landscape, wondering why he felt uneasy. Perhaps it\\nwas the worm they had seen . . . but that was on the other side of the ridge.\\n\\n\\x0cA head popped up into the con-bubble beside Gurney -- the factory commander,\\na one-eyed old pirate with full beard, the blue eyes and milky teeth of a spice\\ndiet.\\n\"Looks like a rich patch, sir,\" the factory commander said. \"Shall I take\\n\\'er in?\"\\n\"Come down at the edge of that ridge,\" Gurney ordered. \"Let me disembark\\nwith my men. You can tractor out to the spice from there. We\\'ll have a look at\\nthat rock.\"\\n\"Aye.\"\\n\"In case of trouble,\" Gurney said, \"save the factory. We\\'ll lift in the\\n\\'thopters.\"\\nThe factory commander saluted. \"Aye, sir.\" He popped back down through the\\nhatch.\\nAgain Gurney scanned the horizon. He had to respect the possibility that\\nthere were Fremen here and he was trespassing. Fremen worried him, their\\ntoughness and unpredictability. Many things about this business worried him, but\\nthe rewards were great. The fact that he couldn\\'t send spotters high overhead\\nworried him, too. The necessity of radio silence added to his uneasiness.\\nThe factory crawler turned, began to descend. Gently it glided down to the\\ndry beach at the foot of the ridge. Treads touched sand.\\nGurney opened the bubble dome, released his safety straps. The instant the\\nfactory stopped, he was out, slamming the bubble closed behind him, scrambling\\nout over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond the emergency\\nnetting. The five men of his personal guard were out with him, emerging from the\\nnose hatch. Others released the factory\\'s carrier wing. It detached, lifted away\\nto fly in a parking circle low overhead.\\nImmediately the big factory crawler lurched off, swinging away from the\\nridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand.\\nA \\'thopter swooped down nearby, skidded to a stop. Another followed and\\nanother. They disgorged Gurney\\'s platoon and lifted to hoverflight.\\nGurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit, stretching. He left the filter\\nmask off his face, losing moisture for the sake of a greater need -- the\\ncarrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands. He began climbing up\\ninto the rocks, checking the terrain -- pebbles and pea sand underfoot, the\\nsmell of spice.\\nGood site for an emergency base, he thought. Might be sensible to bury a few\\nsupplies here.\\nHe glanced back, watching his men spread out as they followed him. Good men,\\neven the new ones he hadn\\'t had time to test. Good men. Didn\\'t have to be told\\nevery time what to do. Not a shield glimmer showed on any of them. No cowards in\\nthis bunch, carrying shields into the desert where a worm could sense the field\\nand come to rob them of the spice they found.\\nFrom this slight elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the spice patch\\nabout half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near edge. He\\nglanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude -- not too high. He nodded to\\nhimself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge.\\nIn that instant, the ridge erupted.\\nTwelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering \\'thopters and\\ncarrier wing. There came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler, and the\\nrocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men.\\nGurney had time to think: By the horns of the Great Mother! Rockets! They\\ndare to use rockets!\\nThen he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low, crysknife at\\nthe ready. Two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to left and right. Only\\nthe eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to Gurney between hood\\nand veil of a sand-colored burnoose, but the crouch and readiness warned him\\n\\n\\x0cthat here was a trained fighting man. The eyes were the blue-in-blue of the\\ndeep-desert Fremen.\\nGurney moved one hand toward his own knife, kept his eyes fixed on the\\nother\\'s knife. If they dared use rockets, they\\'d have other projectile weapons.\\nThis moment argued extreme caution. He could tell by sound alone that at least\\npart of his skycover had been knocked out. There were gruntings, too, the noise\\nof several struggles behind him.\\nThe eyes of the fighting man ahead of Gurney followed the motion of hand\\ntoward knife, came back to glare into Gurney\\'s eyes.\\n\"Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck,\" the man said.\\nGurney hesitated. That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit\\nfilter.\\n\"You know my name?\" he said.\\n\"You\\'ve no need of a knife with me, Gurney,\" the man said. He straightened,\\nslipped his crysknife into its sheath back beneath his robe. \"Tell your men to\\nstop their useless resistance.\"\\nThe man threw his hood back, swung the filter aside.\\nThe shock of what he saw froze Gurney\\'s muscles. He thought at first he was\\nlooking at a ghost image of Duke Leto Atreides. Full recognition came slowly.\\n\"Paul,\" he whispered. Then louder: \"Is it truly Paul?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you trust your own eyes?\" Paul asked.\\n\"They said you were dead,\" Gurney rasped. He took a half-step forward.\\n\"Tell your men to submit,\" Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower reaches\\nof the ridge.\\nGurney turned, reluctant to take his eyes off Paul. He saw only a few knots\\nof struggle. Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around. The factory\\ncrawler lay silent with Fremen standing atop it. There were no aircraft\\noverhead.\\n\"Stop the fighting,\" Gurney bellowed. He took a deep breath, cupped his\\nhands for a megaphone. \"This is Gurney Halleck! Stop the fight!\"\\nSlowly, warily, the struggling figures separated. Eyes turned toward him,\\nquestioning.\\n\"These are friends,\" Gurney called.\\n\"Fine friends!\" someone shouted back. \"Half our people murdered.\"\\n\"It\\'s a mistake,\" Gurney said. \"Don\\'t add to it.\"\\nHe turned back to Paul, stared into the youth\\'s blue-blue Fremen eyes.\\nA smile touched Paul\\'s mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression\\nthat reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Paul\\'s grandfather. Gurney saw then the\\nsinewy harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an Atreides -- a\\nleathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance\\nthat seemed to weigh everything in sight.\\n\"They said you were dead,\" Gurney repeated.\\n\"And it seemed the best protection to let them think so,\" Paul said.\\nGurney realized that was all the apology he\\'d ever get for having been\\nabandoned to his own resources, left to believe his young Duke . . . his friend,\\nwas dead. He wondered then if there were anything left here of the boy he had\\nknown and trained in the ways of fighting men.\\nPaul took a step closer to Gurney, found that his eyes were smarting.\\n\"Gurney . . . \"\\nIt seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each other\\non the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh.\\n\"You young pup! You young pup!\" Gurney kept saying.\\nAnd Paul: \"Gurney, man! Gurney, man!\"\\nPresently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep\\nbreath. \"So you\\'re why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics. I\\nmight\\'ve known. They keep doing things I could\\'ve planned myself. If I\\'d only\\n\\n\\x0cknown . . . \" He shook his head. \"If you\\'d only got word to me, lad. Nothing\\nwould\\'ve stopped me. I\\'d have come arunning and . . . \"\\nA look in Paul\\'s eyes stopped him . . . the hard, weighing stare.\\nGurney sighed. \"Sure, and there\\'d have been those who wondered why Gurney\\nHalleck went arunning, and some would\\'ve done more than question. They\\'d have\\ngone hunting for answers.\"\\nPaul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them -- the looks of\\ncurious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin. He turned from the death\\ncommandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled him with\\nelation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the\\nfuture where all was well.\\nWith Gurney at my side . . .\\nPaul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, studied the smuggler crew who\\nhad come with Halleck.\\n\"How do your men stand, Gurney?\" he asked.\\n\"They\\'re smugglers all,\" Gurney said. \"They stand where the profit is.\"\\n\"Little enough profit in our venture,\" Paul said, and he noted the subtle\\nfinger signal flashed to him by Gurney\\'s right hand -- the old hand code out of\\ntheir past. There were men to fear and distrust in the smuggler crew.\\nPaul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men\\nstanding guard above them on the rocks. He saw Stilgar there. Memory of the\\nunsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Paul\\'s elation.\\n\"Stilgar,\" he said, \"this is Gurney Halleck of whom you\\'ve heard me speak.\\nMy father\\'s master-of-arms, one of the swordmasters who instructed me, an old\\nfriend. He can be trusted in any venture.\"\\n\"I hear,\" Stilgar said. \"You are his Duke.\"\\nPaul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had\\nimpelled Stilgar to say just that. His Duke. There had been a strange subtle\\nintonation in Stilgar\\'s voice, as though he would rather have said something\\nelse. And that wasn\\'t like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke\\nhis mind.\\nMy Duke! Gurney thought. He looked anew at Paul. Yes, with Leto dead, the\\ntitle fell on Paul\\'s shoulders.\\nThe pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in\\nGurney\\'s mind. My Duke! A place that had been dead within him began coming\\nalive. Only part of his awareness focused on Paul\\'s ordering the smuggler crew\\ndisarmed until they could be questioned.\\nGurney\\'s mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men\\nprotesting. He shook his head, whirled. \"Are you men deaf?\" he barked. \"This is\\nthe rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands.\"\\nGrumbling, the smugglers submitted.\\nPaul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. \"I\\'d not have expected\\nyou to walk into this trap, Gurney.\"\\n\"I\\'m properly chastened,\" Gurney said. \"I\\'ll wager yon patch of spice is\\nlittle more than a sand grain\\'s thickness, a bait to lure us.\"\\n\"That\\'s a wager you\\'d win,\" Paul said. He looked down at the men being\\ndisarmed. \"Are there any more of my father\\'s men among your crew?\"\\n\"None. We\\'re spread thin. There\\'re a few among the free traders. Most have\\nspent their profits to leave this place.\"\\n\"But you stayed.\"\\n\"I stayed.\"\\n\"Because Rabban is here,\" Paul said.\\n\"I thought I had nothing left but revenge,\" Gurney said.\\nAn oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see a\\nFremen waving his kerchief.\\n\"A maker comes,\" Paul said. He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney\\nfollowing, looked off to the southwest. The burrow mound of a worm could be seen\\n\\n\\x0cin the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut directly through the dunes\\non a course toward the ridge.\\n\"He\\'s big enough,\" Paul said.\\nA clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them. It turned on\\nits treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.\\n\"Too bad we couldn\\'t have saved the carryall,\" Paul said.\\nGurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on\\nthe desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by Fremen\\nrockets. He felt a sudden pang for the men lost there -- his men, and he said:\\n\"Your father would\\'ve been more concerned for the men he couldn\\'t save.\"\\nPaul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze. Presently, he said: \"They\\nwere your friends, Gurney. I understand. To us, though, they were trespassers\\nwho might see things they shouldn\\'t see. You must understand that.\"\\n\"I understand it well enough,\" Gurney said. \"Now, I\\'m curious to see what I\\nshouldn\\'t.\"\\nPaul looked up to see the old and well-remembered wolfish grin on Halleck\\'s\\nface, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the man\\'s jaw.\\nGurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were going about their\\nbusiness all over the landscape. It struck him that none of them appeared\\nworried by the approach of the worm.\\nA thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice -- a\\ndeep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet. Gurney saw Fremen\\nspread out across the sand there in the path of the worm.\\nThe worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its rings\\nrippling and twisting. In a moment, from his vantage point above the desert,\\nGurney saw the taking of a worm -- the daring leap of the first hookman, the\\nturning of the creature, the way an entire band of men went up the scaly,\\nglistening curve of the worm\\'s side.\\n\"There\\'s one of the things you shouldn\\'t have seen,\" Paul said.\\n\"There\\'s been stories and rumors,\" Gurney said. \"But it\\'s not a thing easy\\nto believe without seeing it.\" He shook his head. \"The creature all men on\\nArrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal.\"\\n\"You heard my father speak of desert power,\" Paul said. \"There it is. The\\nsurface of this planet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition can stop\\nus.\"\\nUs, Gurney thought. He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one of\\nthem. Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Paul\\'s eyes. His own eyes, he\\nknew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods and there\\nwas a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them. They spoke of\\n\"the touch of the spicebrush\" to mean a man had gone too native. And there was\\nalways a hint of distrust in the idea.\\n\"There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in\\nthese latitudes,\" Paul said. \"But Rabban has little enough air cover left that\\nhe can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand.\" He looked at Gurney.\\n\"Your aircraft were a shock to us here.\"\\nTo us . . . to us . . .\\nGurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. \"We weren\\'t the shock to\\nyou that you were to us,\" he said.\\n\"What\\'s the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?\" Paul asked.\\n\"They say they\\'ve fortified the graben villages to the point where you\\ncannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their defenses while you\\nwear yourselves out in futile attack.\"\\n\"In a word,\" Paul said, \"they\\'re immobilized.\"\\n\"While you can go where you will,\" Gurney said.\\n\"It\\'s a tactic I learned from you,\" Paul said. \"They\\'ve lost the initiative,\\nwhich means they\\'ve lost the war.\"\\nGurney smiled, a slow, knowing expression.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be,\" Paul said. He glanced at\\nGurney. \"Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign?\"\\n\"Enlist?\" Gurney stared at him. \"My Lord, I\\'ve never left your service.\\nYou\\'re the only one left me . . . to think you dead. And I, being cast adrift,\\nmade what shrift I could, waiting for the moment I might sell my life for what\\nit\\'s worth -- the death of Rabban.\"\\nAn embarrassed silence settled over Paul.\\nA woman came climbing up the rocks toward them, her eyes between stillsuit\\nhood and facemask flicking between Paul and his companion. She stopped in front\\nof Paul. Gurney noted the possessive air about her, the way she stood close to\\nPaul.\\n\"Chani,\" Paul said, \"this is Gurney Halleck. You\\'ve heard me speak of him.\"\\nShe looked at Halleck, back to Paul. \"I have heard.\"\\n\"Where did the men go on the maker?\" Paul asked.\\n\"They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment.\"\\n\"Well then . . .\" Paul broke off, sniffed the air.\\n\"There\\'s wind coming,\" Chani said.\\nA voice called out from the ridgetop above them: \"Ho, there -- the wind!\"\\nGurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now -- a rushing about\\nand sense of hurry. A thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear\\nof the wind. The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a\\nway was opened for it among the rocks . . . and the rocks closed behind it so\\nneatly that the passage escaped his eyes.\\n\"Have you many such hiding places?\" Gurney asked.\\n\"Many times many,\" Paul said. He looked at Chani. \"Find Korba. Tell him that\\nGurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew who\\'re not to be\\ntrusted.\"\\nShe looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks,\\nleaping with a gazelle-like agility.\\n\"She is your woman,\" Gurney said.\\n\"The mother of my firstborn,\" Paul said. \"There\\'s another Leto among the\\nAtreides.\"\\nGurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.\\nPaul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color\\ndominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind\\nthat whipped dust around their heads.\\n\"Seal your suit,\" Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his\\nface.\\nGurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.\\nPaul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: \"Which of your crew don\\'t you\\ntrust, Gurney?\"\\n\"There\\'re some new recruits,\" Gurney said. \"Offworlders . . . \" He\\nhesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so\\neasily to his tongue.\\n\"Yes?\" Paul said.\\n\"They\\'re not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get,\" Gurney said.\\n\"They\\'re tougher.\"\\n\"Harkonnen spies?\" Paul asked.\\n\"I think m\\'Lord, that they report to no Harkonnen. I suspect they\\'re men of\\nthe Imperial service. They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about them.\"\\nPaul shot a sharp glance at him. \"Sardaukar?\"\\nGurney shrugged. \"They could be, but it\\'s well masked.\"\\nPaul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern of\\nAtreides retainer . . . but with subtle reservations . . . differences. Arrakis\\nhad changed him, too.\\nTwo hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing\\nupward. One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Where are my crew now?\" Gurney asked.\\n\"Secure in the rocks below us,\" Paul said. \"We\\'ve a cave here -- Cave of\\nBirds. We\\'ll decide what to do with them after the storm.\"\\nA voice called from above them: \"Muad\\'Dib!\"\\nPaul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave.\\nPaul signaled he had heard.\\nGurney studying him with a new expression. \"You\\'re Muad\\'Dib?\" he asked.\\n\"You\\'re the will-o\\'-the-sand?\"\\n\"It\\'s my Fremen name,\" Paul said.\\nGurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding. Half his own\\ncrew dead on the sand, the others captive. He did not care about the new\\nrecruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men, friends,\\npeople for whom he felt responsible. \"We\\'ll decide what to do with them after\\nthe storm.\" That\\'s what Paul had said, Muad\\'Dib had said. And Gurney recalled\\nthe stories told of Muad\\'Dib, the Lisan al-Gaib -- how he had taken the skin of\\na Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded by death\\ncommandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their\\nlips.\\nHim.\\nThe two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of\\nPaul. The dark-faced one said: \"All secure, Muad\\'Dib. We best get below now.\"\\n\"Right.\"\\nGurney noted the tone of the man\\'s voice -- half command and half request.\\nThis was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new Fremen legends.\\nPaul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: \"Korba, what\\'s in the\\nbundle?\"\\nStilgar answered: \" \\'Twas in the crawler. It had the initial of your friend\\nhere and it contains a baliset. Many times have I heard you speak of the prowess\\nof Gurney Halleck on the baliset.\"\\nGurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the\\nstillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.\\n\"You\\'ve a companion who thinks, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said. \"Thank you, Stilgar.\"\\nStilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said:\\n\"Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here.\"\\nGurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this\\nconversation. There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney wondered\\nif it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen. Here was someone called\\nGurney Halleck who\\'d known Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who\\nshared a camaraderie that Stilgar could never invade.\\n\"You are two I\\'d have be friends,\" Paul said.\\n\"Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown,\" Gurney said. \"Any killer of\\nHarkonnens I\\'d feel honored to count among my friends.\"\\n\"Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?\" Paul asked.\\nSlowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy calluses of Gurney\\'s\\nswordhand. \"There\\'re few who haven\\'t heard the name of Gurney Halleck,\" he said,\\nand released his grip. He turned to Paul. \"The storm comes rushing.\"\\n\"At once,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and turning\\npath into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave. Men\\nhurried to fasten a doorseal behind them. Glowglobes showed a broad, dome-ceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from\\nit.\\nPaul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into the\\npassage. The others headed for another passage opposite the entrance. Paul led\\nthe way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-colored hangings\\non its walls.\\n\\n\\x0c\"We can have some privacy here for a while,\" Paul said. \"The others will\\nrespect my --\"\\nAn alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting and\\nclashing of weapons. Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and out onto\\nthe atrium lip above the outer chamber. Gurney was right behind, weapon drawn.\\nBeneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures.\\nPaul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the Fremen robes and\\nbourkas from the costumes of those they opposed. Senses that his mother had\\ntrained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant fact -- the\\nFremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes, but the smugglers were\\ncrouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed.\\nThat habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.\\nA Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battlecry was lifted to echo in\\nthe chamber: \"Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib!\"\\nAnother eye had also picked Paul out. A black knife came hurtling toward\\nhim. Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him, glanced to\\nsee Gurney retrieve it.\\nThe triangular knots were being pressed back now.\\nGurney held the knife up in front of Paul\\'s eyes, pointed to the hairline\\nyellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest, multifaceted eyes at the\\npommel.\\nSardaukar for certain.\\nPaul stepped out to the lip of the ledge. Only three of the Sardaukar\\nremained. Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted pattern\\nacross the chamber.\\n\"Hold!\" Paul shouted. \"The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!\"\\nThe fighting wavered, hesitated.\\n\"You Sardaukar!\" Paul called to the remaining group. \"By whose orders do you\\nthreaten a ruling Duke?\" And, quickly, as his men started to press in around the\\nSardaukar: \"Hold, I say!\"\\nOne of the cornered trio straightened. \"Who says we\\'re Sardaukar?\" he\\ndemanded.\\nPaul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. \"This says you\\'re\\nSardaukar.\"\\n\"Then who says you\\'re a ruling Duke?\" the man demanded.\\nPaul gestured to the Fedaykin. \"These men say I\\'m a ruling Duke. Your own\\nemperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. I am House Atreides.\"\\nThe Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.\\nPaul studied the man -- tall, flat-featured, with a pale scar across half\\nhis left cheek. Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there\\nwas that pride about him without which a Sardaukar appeared undressed -- and\\nwith which he could appear fully clothed though naked.\\nPaul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: \"Korba, how came they\\nto have weapons?\"\\n\"They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their\\nstillsuits,\" the lieutenant said.\\nPaul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his attention\\nback to the lieutenant. There was no need for words. The lieutenant lowered his\\neyes.\\n\"Where is Chani?\" Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.\\n\"Stilgar spirited her aside.\" He nodded toward the other passage, glanced at\\nthe dead and wounded. \"I hold myself responsible for this mistake, Muad\\'Dib.\"\\n\"How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Ten.\"\\nPaul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand\\nwithin striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.\\n\\n\\x0cA tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus exposed to\\ndanger. This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the Fremen\\nwished to preserve the wisdom of Muad\\'Dib.\\nWithout turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: \"How many are our\\ncasualties?\"\\n\"Four wounded, two dead, Muad\\'Dib.\"\\nPaul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar, Chani and Stilgar were standing in the\\nother passage. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring into the\\noffworld whites of the spokesman\\'s eyes. \"You, what is your name?\" Paul\\ndemanded.\\nThe man stiffened, glanced left and right.\\n\"Don\\'t try it,\" Paul said. \"It\\'s obvious to me that you were ordered to seek\\nout and destroy Muad\\'Dib. I\\'ll warrant you were the ones suggested seeking spice\\nin the deep desert.\"\\nA gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin smile to Paul\\'s lips.\\nBlood suffused the Sardaukar\\'s face.\\n\"What you see before you is more than Muad\\'Dib,\" Paul said. \"Seven of you\\nare dead for two of us. Three for one. Pretty good against Sardaukar, eh?\"\\nThe man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.\\n\"I asked your name,\" Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice:\\n\"Tell me your name!\"\\n\"Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!\" the man snapped. His jaw dropped. He\\nstared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern\\nas a barbarian warren melted away.\\n\"Well, Captain Aramsham,\" Paul said, \"the Harkonnens would pay dearly to\\nlearn what you now know. And the Emperor -- what he wouldn\\'t give to learn an\\nAtreides still lives despite his treachery.\"\\nThe captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him. Paul\\ncould almost see the thoughts turning over in the man\\'s head. Sardaukar did not\\nsubmit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.\\nStill using the Voice, Paul said: \"Submit, Captain.\"\\nThe man at the captain\\'s left leaped without warning toward Paul, met the\\nflashing impact of his own captain\\'s knife in his chest. The attacker hit the\\nfloor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.\\nThe captain faced his sole remaining companion. \"I decide what best serves\\nHis Majesty,\" he said. \"Understood?\"\\nThe other Sardaukar\\'s shoulders slumped.\\n\"Drop your weapon,\" the captain said.\\nThe Sardaukar obeyed.\\nThe captain returned his attention to Paul. \"I have killed a friend for\\nyou,\" he said. \"Let us always remember that.\"\\n\"You\\'re my prisoners,\" Paul said. \"You submitted to me. Whether you live or\\ndie is of no importance.\" He motioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar,\\nsignaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.\\nThe guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.\\nPaul bent toward his lieutenant.\\n\"Muad\\'Dib,\" the man said. \"I failed you in . . . \"\\n\"The failure was mine, Korba,\" Paul said. \"I should\\'ve warned you what to\\nseek. In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this. Remember, too,\\nthat each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items\\nsecreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter. They\\'ll have more\\nthan one false tooth. They carry coils of shigawire in their hair -- so fine you\\ncan barely detect it, yet strong enough to garrote a man and cut off his head in\\nthe process. With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope them -- both reflex and\\nhard ray -- cut off every scrap of body hair. And when you\\'re through, be\\ncertain you haven\\'t discovered everything.\"\\nHe looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Then we best kill them,\" the lieutenant said.\\nPaul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. \"No. I want them to escape.\"\\nGurney stared at him.\\n\"Sire . . . \" he breathed.\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"Your man here is right. Kill those prisoners at once. Destroy all evidence\\nof them. You\\'ve shamed Imperial Sardaukar! When the Emperor learns that he\\'ll\\nnot rest until he has you over a slow fire.\"\\n\"The Emperor\\'s not likely to have that power over me,\" Paul said. He spoke\\nslowly, coldly. Something had happened inside him while he faced the Sardaukar.\\nA sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness. \"Gurney,\" he said, \"are\\nthere many Guildsmen around Rabban?\"\\nGurney straightened, eyes narrowed. \"Your question makes no . . . \"\\n\"Are there?\" Paul barked.\\n\"Arrakis is crawling with Guild agents. They\\'re buying spice as though it\\nwere the most precious thing in the universe. Why else do you think we ventured\\nthis far into . . . \"\\n\"It is the most precious thing in the universe,\" Paul said. \"To them.\"\\nHe looked toward Stilgar and Chani who were now crossing the chamber toward\\nhim. \"And we control it, Gurney.\"\\n\"The Harkonnens control it!\" Gurney protested.\\n\"The people who can destroy a thing, they control it,\" Paul said. He waved a\\nhand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar who stopped in\\nfront of Paul, Chani beside him.\\nPaul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar.\\n\"You live for the good of the tribe,\" Paul said. \"Could you draw my life\\'s blood\\nwith that knife?\"\\n\"For the good of the tribe,\" Stilgar growled.\\n\"Then use that knife,\" Paul said.\\n\"Are you calling me out?\" Stilgar demanded.\\n\"If I do,\" Paul said, \"I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay\\nme.\"\\nStilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.\\nChani said, \"Usul!\" then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.\\nWhile Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: \"You are Stilgar, a\\nfighting man. When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in the front\\nof battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani.\"\\n\"She\\'s my niece,\" Stilgar said. \"If there\\'d been any doubt of your Fedaykin\\nhandling those scum . . . \"\\n\"Why was your first thought of Chani?\" Paul demanded.\\n\"It wasn\\'t!\"\\n\"Oh?\"\\n\"It was of you,\" Stilgar admitted.\\n\"Do you think you could lift your hand against me?\" Paul asked. Stilgar\\nbegan to tremble. \"It\\'s the way,\" he muttered.\\n\"It\\'s the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their\\nwater as a gift from Shai-hulud,\" Paul said. \"Yet you permitted two such to live\\none night, my mother and myself.\"\\nAs Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: \"Ways\\nchange, Stil. You have changed them yourself.\"\\nStilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held.\\n\"When I am Duke in Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think I\\'ll have\\ntime to concern myself with every detail of governing Tabr sietch?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family?\"\\nStilgar continued staring at the knife.\\n\"Do you think I wish to cut off my right arm?\" Paul demanded.\\nSlowly, Stilgar looked up at him.\\n\\n\\x0c\"You!\" Paul said. \"Do you think I wish to deprive myself or the tribe of\\nyour wisdom and strength?\"\\nIn a low voice, Stilgar said: \"The young man of my tribe whose name is known\\nto me, this young man I could kill on the challenge floor, Shai-hulud willing.\\nThe Lisan al-Gaib, him I could not harm. You knew this when you handed me this\\nknife.\"\\n\"I knew it,\" Paul agreed.\\nStilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the floor.\\n\"Ways change,\" he said.\\n\"Chani,\" Paul said, \"go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be\\navailable in --\"\\n\"But you said we would go to the south!\" she protested.\\n\"I was wrong,\" he said. \"The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not\\nthere.\"\\nShe took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all\\nnecessities in the midst of a life involved with death.\\n\"You will give my mother a message for her ears alone,\" Paul said. \"Tell her\\nthat Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be found to make\\nthe young men accept this without combat.\"\\nChani glanced at Stilgar.\\n\"Do as he says,\" Stilgar growled. \"We both know he could overcome me . . .\\nand I could not raise my hand against him . . . for the good of the tribe.\"\\n\"I shall return with your mother,\" Chani said.\\n\"Send her,\" Paul said. \"Stilgar\\'s instinct was right. I am stronger when you\\nare safe. You will remain in the sietch.\"\\nShe started to protest, swallowed it.\\n\"Sihaya,\" Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to the\\nright, met Gurney\\'s glaring eyes.\\nThe interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a\\ncloud around Gurney since Paul\\'s reference to his mother.\\n\"Your mother,\" Gurney said.\\n\"Idaho saved us the night of the raid,\" Paul said, distracted by the parting\\nwith Chani. \"Right now we\\'ve --\"\\n\"What of Duncan Idaho, m\\'Lord?\" Gurney asked.\\n\"He\\'s dead -- buying us a bit of time to escape.\"\\nThe she-witch alive! Gurney thought. The one I swore vengeance against,\\nalive! And it\\'s obvious Duke Paul doesn\\'t know what manner of creature gave him\\nbirth. The evil one! Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!\\nPaul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge. He glanced back, noted that\\nthe wounded and dead had been removed, and he thought bitterly that here was\\nanother chapter in the legend of Paul Muad\\'Dib. I didn\\'t even draw my knife, but\\nit\\'ll be said of this day that I slew twenty Sardaukar by my own hand.\\nGurney followed with Stilgar, stepping on ground that he did not even feel.\\nThe cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by\\nrage. The she-witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves.\\nI must contrive it that Paul learns the truth about her before I slay her.\\n', 46: '\\nHow often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is\\ntelling him.\\n-\"The Collected Sayings of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe crowd in the cavern assembly chamber radiated that pack feeling Jessica\\nhad sensed the day Paul killed Jamis.

She felt rested after the long journey up\\nfrom the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the\\ncaptured ornithopters.\\n\"We do not have full control of the air,\" he had said. \"And we must not\\nbecome dependent upon offworld fuel. Both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and\\nsaved for the day of maximum effort.\"\\nPaul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge. The pale light of\\nglowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality. It was like a tableau, but with\\nthe added dimension of warren smells, the whispers, the sounds of shuffling\\nfeet.\\nShe studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise - Gurney Halleck. Thought of Gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier\\npast -- days of love and beauty with Paul\\'s father.\\nStilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge.\\nThere was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without\\ntalking.\\nWe must not lose that man, Jessica thought. Paul\\'s plan must work. Anything\\nelse would be highest tragedy.\\nShe strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down\\ninto the crowd. A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul. And silence\\nfollowed her.\\nShe knew the meaning of the silence -- the unspoken questions of the people,\\nawe of the Reverend Mother.\\nThe young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found\\nherself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him. \"All men\\nbeneath your position covet your station,\" went the Bene Gesserit axiom. But she\\nfound no covetousness in these faces. They were held at a distance by the\\nreligious ferment around Paul\\'s leadership. And she recalled another Bene\\nGesserit saying: \"Prophets have a way of dying by violence.\"\\nPaul looked at her.\\n\"It\\'s time,\" she said, and passed the message cylinder to him.\\nOne of Paul\\'s companions, bolder than the others, glanced across at Stilgar,\\nsaid: \"Are you going to call him out, Muad\\'Dib? Now\\'s the time for sure. They\\'ll\\nthink you a coward if you --\"\\n\"Who dares call me coward?\" Paul demanded. His hand flashed to his crysknife\\nhilt.\\nBated silence came over the group, spreading out into the crowd.\\n\"There\\'s work to do,\" Paul said as the man drew back from him. Paul turned\\naway, shouldered through the crowd to the ledge, leaped lightly up to it and\\nfaced the people.\\n\"Do it!\" someone shrieked.\\nMurmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek.\\nPaul waited for silence. It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and\\ncoughs. When it was quiet in the cavern, Paul lifted his chin, spoke in a voice\\nthat carried to the farthest corners.\\n\"You are tired of waiting,\" Paul said.\\nAgain, he waited while the cries of response died out.\\nIndeed, they are tired of waiting, Paul thought. He hefted the message\\ncylinder, thinking of what it contained. His mother had showed it to him,\\nexplaining how it had been taken from a Harkonnen courier.\\nThe message was explicit: Rabban was being abandoned to his own resources\\nhere on Arrakis! He could not call for help or reinforcements!\\nAgain, Paul raised his voice: \"You think it\\'s time I called out Stilgar and\\nchanged the leadership of the troops!\" Before they could respond, Paul hurled\\nhis voice at them in anger: \"Do you think the Lisan al-Gaib that stupid?\"\\nThere was stunned silence.\\n\\n\\x0cHe\\'s accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thought. He must not do it!\\n\"It\\'s the way!\" someone shouted.\\nPaul spoke dryly, probing the emotional undercurrents. \"Ways change.\"\\nAn angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern: \"We\\'ll say what\\'s to\\nchange!\"\\nThere were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng.\\n\"As you wish,\" Paul said.\\nAnd Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of Voice she\\nhad taught him.\\n\"You will say,\" he agreed. \"But first you will hear my say.\"\\nStilgar moved along the ledge, his bearded face impassive. \"That is the way,\\ntoo,\" he said. \"The voice of any Fremen may be heard in Council. Paul-Muad\\'Dib\\nis a Fremen.\"\\n\"The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?\" Paul asked.\\nStill with that flat-voiced dignity, Stilgar said: \"Thus our steps are\\nguided.\"\\n\"All right,\" Paul said. \"Then, who rules this troop of our tribe -- and who\\nrules all the tribes and troops through the fighting instructors we\\'ve trained\\nin the weirding way?\"\\nPaul waited, looking over the heads of the throng. No answer came.\\nPresently, he said: \"Does Stilgar rule all this? He says himself that he\\ndoes not. Do I rule? Even Stilgar does my bidding on occasion, and the sages,\\nthe wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council.\"\\nThere was shuffling silence among the crowd.\\n\"So,\" Paul said. \"Does my mother rule?\" He pointed down to Jessica in her\\nblack robes of office among them. \"Stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask\\nher advice in almost every major decision. You know this. But does a Reverend\\nMother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the Harkonnens?\"\\nFrowns creased the foreheads of those Paul could see, but still there were\\nangry murmurs.\\nThis is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the\\nmessage cylinder and what it implied. And she saw Paul\\'s intent: Go right to the\\ndepth of their uncertainty, dispose of that, and all the rest must follow.\\n\"No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh?\"\\nPaul asked.\\n\"That\\'s the way!\" someone shouted.\\n\"What\\'s our goal?\" Paul asked. \"To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast, and\\nremake our world into a place where we may raise our families in happiness\\namidst an abundance of water -- is this our goal?\"\\n\"Hard tasks need hard ways,\" someone shouted.\\n\"Do you smash your knife before a battle?\" Paul demanded. \"I say this as\\nfact, not meaning it as boast or challenge: there isn\\'t a man here, Stilgar\\nincluded, who could stand against me in single combat. This is Stilgar\\'s own\\nadmission. He knows it, so do you all.\"\\nAgain, the angry mutters lifted from the crowd.\\n\"Many of you have been with me on the practice floor,\" Paul said. \"You know\\nthis isn\\'t idle boast. I say it because it\\'s fact known to us all, and I\\'d be\\nfoolish not to see it for myself. I began training in these ways earlier than\\nyou did and my teachers were tougher than any you\\'ve ever seen. How else do you\\nthink I bested Jamis at an age when your boys are still fighting only mock\\nbattles?\"\\nHe\\'s using the Voice well, Jessica thought, but that\\'s not enough with these\\npeople. They\\'ve good insulation against vocal control. He must catch them also\\nwith logic.\\n\"So,\" Paul said, \"we come to this.\" He lifted the message cylinder, removed\\nits scrap of tape. \"This was taken from a Harkonnen courier. Its authenticity is\\nbeyond question. It is addressed to Rabban. It tells him that his request for\\n\\n\\x0cnew troops is denied, that his spice harvest is far below quota, that he must\\nwring more spice from Arrakis with the people he has.\"\\nStilgar moved up beside Paul.\\n\"How many of you see what this means?\" Paul asked. \"Stilgar saw it\\nimmediately.\"\\n\"They\\'re cut off!\" someone shouted.\\nPaul pushed message and cylinder into his sash. From his neck he took a\\nbraided shigawire cord and removed a ring from the cord, holding the ring aloft.\\n\"This was my father\\'s ducal signet,\" he said. \"I swore never to wear it\\nagain until I was ready to lead my troops over all of Arrakis and claim it as my\\nrightful fief.\" He put the ring on his finger, clenched his fist.\\nUtter stillness gripped the cavern.\\n\"Who rules here?\" Paul asked. He raised his fist. \"I rule here! I rule on\\nevery square inch of Arrakis! This is my ducal fief whether the Emperor says yea\\nor nay! He gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father!\"\\nPaul lifted himself onto his toes, settled back to his heels. He studied the\\ncrowd, feeling their temper.\\nAlmost, he thought.\\n\"There are men here who will hold positions of importance on Arrakis when I\\nclaim those Imperial rights which are mine,\" Paul said. \"Stilgar is one of those\\nmen. Not because I wish to bribe him! Not out of gratitude, though I\\'m one of\\nmany here who owe him life for life. No! But because he\\'s wise and strong.\\nBecause he governs this troop by his own intelligence and not just by rules. Do\\nyou think me stupid? Do you think I\\'ll cut off my right arm and leave it bloody\\non the floor of this cavern just to provide you with a circus?\"\\nPaul swept a hard gaze across the throng. \"Who is there here to say I\\'m not\\nthe rightful ruler on Arrakis? Must I prove it by leaving every Fremen tribe in\\nthe erg without a leader?\"\\nBeside Paul, Stilgar stirred, looked at him questioningly.\\n\"Will I subtract from our strength when we need it most?\" Paul asked. \"I am\\nyour ruler, and I say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men\\nand started killing our real enemies -- the Harkonnens!\"\\nIn one blurred motion, Stilgar had his crysknife out and pointed over the\\nheads of the throng. \"Long live Duke Paul-Muad\\'Dib!\" he shouted.\\nA deafening roar filled the cavern, echoed and re-echoed. They were cheering\\nand chanting: \"Ya hya chouhada! Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib! Ya hya chouhada!\"\\nJessica translated it to herself: \"Long live the fighters of Muad\\'Dib!\" The\\nscene she and Paul and Stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as they\\'d\\nplanned.\\nThe tumult died slowly.\\nWhen silence was restored, Paul faced Stilgar, said: \"Kneel, Stilgar.\"\\nStilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge.\\n\"Hand me your crysknife,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar obeyed.\\nThis was not as we planned it, Jessica thought.\\n\"Repeat after me, Stilgar,\" Paul said, and he called up the words of\\ninvestiture as he had heard his own father use them. \"I, Stilgar, take this\\nknife from the hands of my Duke.\"\\n\"I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke,\" Stilgar said, and\\naccepted the milky blade from Paul.\\n\"Where my Duke commands, there shall I place this blade,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly.\\nRemembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her\\nhead. I know the reasons for this, she thought. I shouldn\\'t let it stir me.\\n\"I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his enemies\\nfor as long as our blood shall flow,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar repeated it after him.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Kiss the blade,\" Paul ordered.\\nStilgar obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Paul\\'s knife arm. At a\\nnod from Paul, he sheathed the blade, got to his feet.\\nA sighing whisper of awe passed through the crowd, and Jessica heard the\\nwords: \"The prophecy -- A Bene Gesserit shall show the way and a Reverend Mother\\nshall see it.\" And, from farther away: \"She shows us through her son!\"\\n\"Stilgar leads this tribe,\" Paul said. \"Let no man mistake that. He commands\\nwith my voice. What he tells you, it is as though I told you.\"\\nWise, Jessica thought. The tribal commander must lose no face among those\\nwho should obey him.\\nPaul lowered his voice, said: \"Stilgar, I want sandwalkers out this night\\nand cielagos sent to summon a Council Gathering. When you\\'ve sent them, bring\\nChatt, Korba and Otheym and two other lieutenants of your own choosing. Bring\\nthem to my quarters for battle planning. We must have a victory to show the\\nCouncil of Leaders when they arrive.\"\\nPaul nodded for his mother to accompany him, led the way down off the ledge\\nand through the throng toward the central passage and the living chambers that\\nhad been prepared there. As Paul pressed through the crowd, hands reached out to\\ntouch him. Voices called out to him.\\n\"My knife goes where Stilgar commands it, Paul-Muad\\'Dib! Let us fight soon,\\nPaul-Muad\\'Dib! Let us wet our world with the blood of Harkonnens!\"\\nFeeling the emotions of the throng, Jessica sensed the fighting edge of\\nthese people. They could not be more ready. We are taking them at the crest, she\\nthought.\\nIn the inner chamber, Paul motioned his mother to be seated, said: \"Wait\\nhere.\" And he ducked through the hangings to the side passage.\\nIt was quiet in the chamber after Paul had gone, so quiet behind the\\nhangings that not even the faint soughing of the wind pumps that circulated air\\nin the sietch penetrated to where she sat.\\nHe is going to bring Gurney Halleck here, she thought. And she wondered at\\nthe strange mingling of emotions that filled her. Gurney and his music had been\\na part of so many pleasant times on Caladan before the move to Arrakis. She felt\\nthat Caladan had happened to some other person. In the nearly three years since\\nthen, she had become another person. Having to confront Gurney forced a\\nreassessment of the changes.\\nPaul\\'s coffee service, the fluted alloy of silver and jasmium that he had\\ninherited from Jamis, rested on a low table to her right. She stared at it,\\nthinking of how many hands had touched that metal. Chani had served Paul from it\\nwithin the month.\\nWhat can his desert woman do for a Duke except serve him coffee? she asked\\nherself. She brings him no power, no family. Paul has only one major chance -to ally himself with a powerful Great House, perhaps even with the Imperial\\nfamily. There are marriageable princesses, after all, and every one of them Bene\\nGesserit trained.\\nJessica imagined herself leaving the rigors of Arrakis for the life of power\\nand security she could know as mother of a royal consort. She glanced at the\\nthick hangings that obscured the rock of this cavern cell, thinking of how she\\nhad come here -- riding amidst a host of worms, the palanquins and pack\\nplatforms piled high with necessities for the coming campaign.\\nAs long as Chani lives, Paul will not see his duty, Jessica thought. She has\\ngiven him a son and that is enough.\\nA sudden longing to see her grandson, the child whose likeness carried so\\nmuch of the grandfather\\'s features -- so like Leto, swept through her. Jessica\\nplaced her palms against her cheeks, began the ritual breathing that stilled\\nemotion and clarified the mind, then bent forward from the waist in the\\ndevotional exercise that prepared the body for the mind\\'s demands.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul\\'s choice of this Cave of Birds as his command post could not be\\nquestioned, she knew. It was ideal. And to the north lay Wind Pass opening onto\\na protected village in a cliff-walled sink. It was a key village, home of\\nartisans and technicians, maintenance center for an entire Harkonnen defensive\\nsector.\\nA cough sounded outside the chamber hangings. Jessica straightened, took a\\ndeep breath, exhaled slowly. \"Enter,\" she said.\\nDraperies were flung aside and Gurney Halleck bounded into the room. She had\\nonly time for a glimpse of his face with its odd grimace, then he was behind\\nher, lifting her to her feet with one brawny arm beneath her chin.\\n\"Gurney, you fool, what are you doing?\" she demanded.\\nThen she felt the touch of the knife tip against her back. Chill awareness\\nspread out from that knife tip. She knew in that instant that Gurney meant to\\nkill her. Why? She could think of no reason, for he wasn\\'t the kind to turn\\ntraitor. But she felt certain of his intention. Knowing it, her mind churned.\\nHere was no man to be overcome easily. Here was a killer wary of the Voice, wary\\nof every combat stratagem, wary of every trick of death and violence. Here was\\nan instrument she herself had helped train with subtle hints and suggestions.\\n\"You thought you had escaped, eh, witch?\" Gurney snarled.\\nBefore she could turn the question over in her mind or try to answer, the\\ncurtains parted and Paul entered.\\n\"Here he is, Moth --\" Paul broke off, taking in the tensions of the scene.\\n\"You will stand where you are, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said.\\n\"What . . . \" Paul shook his head.\\nJessica started to speak, felt the arm tighten against her throat.\\n\"You will speak only when I permit it, witch,\" Gurney said. \"I want only one\\nthing from you for your son to hear it, and I am prepared to send this knife\\ninto your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter against me. Your voice\\nwill remain in a monotone. Certain muscles you will not tense or move. You will\\nact with the most extreme caution to gain yourself a few more seconds of life.\\nAnd I assure you, these are all you have.\"\\nPaul took a step forward. \"Gurney, man, what is --\"\\n\"Stop right where you are!\" Gurney snapped. \"One more step and she\\'s dead.\"\\nPaul\\'s hand slipped to his knife hilt. He spoke in a deadly quiet: \"You had\\nbest explain yourself, Gurney.\"\\n\"I swore an oath to slay the betrayer of your father,\" Gurney said. \"Do you\\nthink I can forget the man who rescued me from a Harkonnen slave pit, gave me\\nfreedom, life, and honor . . . gave me friendship, a thing I prized above all\\nelse? I have his betrayer under my knife. No one can stop me from --\"\\n\"You couldn\\'t be more wrong, Gurney,\" Paul said.\\nAnd Jessica thought: So that\\'s it! What irony!\\n\"Wrong, am I?\" Gurney demanded. \"Let us hear it from the woman herself. And\\nlet her remember that I have bribed and spied and cheated to confirm this\\ncharge. I\\'ve even pushed semuta on a Harkonnen guard captain to get part of the\\nstory.\"\\nJessica felt the arm at her throat ease slightly, but before she could\\nspeak, Paul said: \"The betrayer was Yueh. I tell you this once, Gurney. The\\nevidence is complete, cannot be controverted. It was Yueh. I do not care how you\\ncame by your suspicion -- for it can be nothing else -- but if you harm my\\nmother . . . \" Paul lifted his crysknife from its scabbard, held the blade in\\nfront of him. \". . . I\\'ll have your blood.\"\\n\"Yueh was a conditioned medic, fit for a royal house,\" Gurney snarled. \"He\\ncould not turn traitor!\"\\n\"I know a way to remove that conditioning,\" Paul said.\\n\"Evidence,\" Gurney insisted.\\n\"The evidence is not here,\" Paul said. \"It\\'s in Tabr sietch, far to the\\nsouth, but if --\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"This is a trick,\" Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessica\\'s\\nthroat.\\n\"No trick, Gurney,\" Paul said, and his voice carried such a note of terrible\\nsadness that the sound tore at Jessica\\'s heart.\\n\"I saw the message captured from the Harkonnen agent,\" Gurney said. \"The\\nnote pointed directly at --\"\\n\"I saw it, too,\" Paul said. \"My father showed it to me the night he\\nexplained why it had to be a Harkonnen trick aimed at making him suspect the\\nwoman he loved.\"\\n\"Ayah!\" Gurney said. \"You\\'ve not --\"\\n\"Be quiet,\" Paul said, and the monotone stillness of his words carried more\\ncommand than Jessica had ever heard in another voice.\\nHe has the Great Control, she thought.\\nGurney\\'s arm trembled against her neck. The point of the knife at her back\\nmoved with uncertainty.\\n\"What you have not done,\" Paul said, \"is heard my mother sobbing in the\\nnight over her lost Duke. You have not seen her eyes stab flame when she speaks\\nof killing Harkonnens.\"\\nSo he has listened, she thought. Tears blinded her eyes.\\n\"What you have not done,\" Paul went on, \"is remembered the lessons you\\nlearned in a Harkonnen slave pit. You speak of pride in my father\\'s friendship!\\nDidn\\'t you learn the difference between Harkonnen and Atreides so that you could\\nsmell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they left on it? Didn\\'t you learn that\\nAtreides loyalty is bought with love while the Harkonnen coin is hate? Couldn\\'t\\nyou see through to the very nature of this betrayal?\"\\n\"But Yueh?\" Gurney muttered.\\n\"The evidence we have is Yueh\\'s own message to us admitting his treachery,\"\\nPaul said. \"I swear this to you by the love I hold for you, a love I will still\\nhold even after I leave you dead on this floor.\"\\nHearing her son, Jessica marveled at the awareness in him, the penetrating\\ninsight of his intelligence.\\n\"My father had an instinct for his friends,\" Paul said. \"He gave his love\\nsparingly, but with never an error. His weakness lay in misunderstanding hatred.\\nHe thought anyone who hated Harkonnens could not betray him.\" He glanced at his\\nmother. \"She knows this. I\\'ve given her my father\\'s message that he never\\ndistrusted her.\"\\nJessica felt herself losing control, bit at her lower lip. Seeing the stiff\\nformality in Paul, she realized what these words were costing him. She wanted to\\nrun to him, cradle his head against her breast as she never had done. But the\\narm against her throat had ceased its trembling; the knifepoint at her back\\npressed still and sharp.\\n\"One of the most terrible moments in a boy\\'s life,\" Paul said, \"is when he\\ndiscovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can\\nnever quite taste. It\\'s a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is there\\nand here and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can\\'t\\nevade it. I heard my father when he spoke of my mother. She\\'s not the betrayer,\\nGurney.\"\\nJessica found her voice, said: \"Gurney, release me.\" There was no special\\ncommand in the words, no trick to play on his weaknesses, but Gurney\\'s hand fell\\naway. She crossed to Paul, stood in front of him, not touching him.\\n\"Paul,\" she said, \"there are other awakenings in this universe. I suddenly\\nsee how I\\'ve used you and twisted you and manipulated you to set you on a course\\nof my choosing . . . a course I had to choose -- if that\\'s any excuse -- because\\nof my own training.\" She swallowed past a lump in her throat, looked up into her\\nson\\'s eyes. \"Paul . . . I want you to do something for me: choose the course of\\nhappiness. Your desert woman, marry her if that\\'s your wish. Defy everyone and\\neverything to do this. But choose your own course. I . . . \"\\n\\n\\x0cShe broke off, stopped by the low sound of muttering behind her.\\nGurney!\\nShe saw Paul\\'s eyes directed beyond her, turned.\\nGurney stood in the same spot, but had sheathed his knife, pulled the robe\\naway from his breast to expose the slick grayness of an issue stillsuit, the\\ntype the smugglers traded for among the sietch warrens.\\n\"Put your knife right here in my breast,\" Gurney muttered. \"I say kill me\\nand have done with it. I\\'ve besmirched my name. I\\'ve betrayed my own Duke! The\\nfinest --\"\\n\"Be still!\" Paul said.\\nGurney stared at him.\\n\"Close that robe and stop acting like a fool,\" Paul said. \"I\\'ve had enough\\nfoolishness for one day.\"\\n\"Kill me, I say!\" Gurney raged.\\n\"You know me better than that,\" Paul said. \"How many kinds of an idiot do\\nyou think I am? Must I go through this with every man I need?\"\\nGurney looked at Jessica, spoke in a forlorn, pleading note so unlike him:\\n\"Then you, my Lady, please . . . you kill me.\"\\nJessica crossed to him, put her hands on his shoulders. \"Gurney, why do you\\ninsist the Atreides must kill those they love?\" Gently, she pulled the spread\\nrobe out of his fingers, closed and fastened the fabric over his chest.\\nGurney spoke brokenly; \"But . . . I . . . \"\\n\"You thought you were doing a thing for Leto,\" she said, \"and for this I\\nhonor you.\"\\n\"My Lady,\" Gurney said. He dropped his chin to his chest, squeezed his\\neyelids closed against the tears.\\n\"Let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends,\" she said,\\nand Paul heard the soothers, the adjusting tones in her voice. \"It\\'s over and we\\ncan be thankful we\\'ll never again have that sort of misunderstanding between\\nus.\"\\nGurney opened eyes bright with moisture, looked down at her.\\n\"The Gurney Halleck I knew was a man adept with both blade and baliset,\"\\nJessica said. \"It was the man of the baliset I most admired. Doesn\\'t that Gurney\\nHalleck remember how I used to enjoy listening by the hour while he played for\\nme? Do you still have a baliset, Gurney?\"\\n\"I\\'ve a new one,\" Gurney said. \"Brought from Chusuk, a sweet instrument.\\nPlays like a genuine Varota, though there\\'s no signature on it. I think myself\\nit was made by a student of Varota\\'s who . . .\" He broke off. \"What can I say to\\nyou, my Lady? Here we prattle about --\"\\n\"Not prattle, Gurney,\" Paul said. He crossed to stand beside his mother, eye\\nto eye with Gurney. \"Not prattle, but a thing that brings happiness between\\nfriends. I\\'d take it a kindness if you\\'d play for her now. Battle planning can\\nwait a little while. We\\'ll not be going into the fight till tomorrow at any\\nrate.\"\\n\"I . . . I\\'ll get my baliset,\" Gurney said. \"It\\'s in the passage.\" He\\nstepped around them and through the hangings.\\nPaul put a hand on his mother\\'s arm, found that she was trembling.\\n\"It\\'s over, Mother,\" he said.\\nWithout turning her head, she looked up at him from the corners of her eyes.\\n\"Over?\"\\n\"Of course. Gurney\\'s . . . \"\\n\"Gurney? Oh . . . yes.\" She lowered her gaze.\\nThe hangings rustled as Gurney returned with his baliset. He began tuning\\nit, avoiding their eyes. The hangings on the walls dulled the echoes, making the\\ninstrument sound small and intimate.\\nPaul led his mother to a cushion, seated her there with her back to the\\nthick draperies of the wall. He was suddenly struck by how old she seemed to him\\n\\n\\x0cwith the beginnings of desert-dried lines in her face, the stretching at the\\ncorners of her blue-veiled eyes.\\nShe\\'s tired, he thought. We must find some way to ease her burdens.\\nGurney strummed a chord.\\nPaul glanced at him, said: \"I\\'ve . . . things that need my attention. Wait\\nhere for me.\"\\nGurney nodded. His mind seemed far away, as though he dwelled for this\\nmoment beneath the open skies of Caladan with cloud fleece on the horizon\\npromising rain.\\nPaul forced himself to turn away, let himself out through the heavy hangings\\nover the side passage. He heard Gurney take up a tune behind him, and paused a\\nmoment outside the room to listen to the muted music.\\n\"Orchards and vineyards,\\nAnd full-breasted houris,\\nAnd a cup overflowing before me.\\nWhy do I babble of battles,\\nAnd mountains reduced to dust?\\nWhy do I feel these tears?\\nHeavens stand open\\nAnd scatter their riches;\\nMy hands need but gather their wealth.\\nWhy do I think of an ambush,\\nAnd poison in molten cup?\\nWhy do I feel my years?\\nLove\\'s arms beckon\\nWith their naked delights,\\nAnd Eden\\'s promise of ecstasies.\\nWhy do I remember the scars,\\nDream of old transgressions . . .\\nAnd why do I sleep with fears?\"\\nA robed Fedaykin courier appeared from a corner of the passage ahead of\\nPaul. The man had hood thrown back and fastenings of his stillsuit hanging loose\\nabout his neck, proof that he had come just now from the open desert.\\nPaul motioned for him to stop, left the hangings of the door and moved down\\nthe passage to the courier.\\nThe man bowed, hands clasped in front of him the way he might greet a\\nReverend Mother or Sayyadina of the rites. He said: \"Muad\\'Dib, leaders are\\nbeginning to arrive for the Council.\"\\n\"So soon?\"\\n\"These are the ones Stilgar sent for earlier when it was thought . . .\" He\\nshrugged.\\n\"I see.\" Paul glanced back toward the faint sound of the baliset, thinking\\nof the old song that his mother favored -- an odd stretching of happy tune and\\nsad words. \"Stilgar will come here soon with others. Show them where my mother\\nwaits.\"\\n\"I will wait here, Muad\\'Dib,\" the courier said.\\n\"Yes . . . yes, do that.\"\\nPaul pressed past the man toward the depths of the cavern, headed for the\\nplace that each such cavern had -- a place near its water-holding basin. There\\nwould be a small shai-hulud in this place, a creature no more than nine meters\\nlong, kept stunted and trapped by surrounding water ditches. The maker, after\\nemerging from its little maker vector, avoided water for the poison it was. And\\nthe drowning of a maker was the greatest Fremen secret because it produced the\\n\\n\\x0csubstance of their union -- the Water of Life, the poison that could only be\\nchanged by a Reverend Mother.\\nThe decision had come to Paul while he faced the tension of danger to his\\nmother. No line of the future he had ever seen carried that moment, of peril\\nfrom Gurney Halleck. The future -- the gray-cloud-future -- with its feeling\\nthat the entire universe rolled toward a boiling nexus hung around him like a\\nphantom world.\\nI must see it, he thought.\\nHis body had slowly acquired a certain spice tolerance that made prescient\\nvisions fewer and fewer . . . dimmer and dimmer. The solution appeared obvious\\nto him.\\nI will drown the maker. We will see now whether I\\'m the Kwisatz Haderach who\\ncan survive the test that the Reverend Mothers have survived.\\n', 47: '\\nAnd it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul-Muad\\'Dib lay\\nalone in the Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell. And he\\nlay as one dead, caught up in the revelation of the Water of Life, his being\\ntranslated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life. Thus was\\nthe prophecy made true that the Lisan al-Gaib might be both dead and alive.\\n-\"Collected Legends of Arrakis\" by the Princess Irulan\\nChani came up out of the Habbanya basin in the predawn darkness, hearing the\\n\\'thopter that had brought her from the south go whir-whirring off to a hiding\\nplace in the vastness. Around her, the escort kept its distance, fanning out\\ninto the rocks of the ridge to probe for dangers -- and giving the mate of\\nMuad\\'Dib, the mother of his firstborn, the thing she had requested: a moment to\\nwalk alone.\\nWhy did he summon me? she asked herself. He told me before that I must\\nremain in the south with little Leto and Alia.\\nShe gathered her robe and leaped lightly up across a barrier rock and onto\\nthe climbing path that only the desert-trained could recognize in the darkness.\\nPebbles slithered underfoot and she danced across them without considering the\\nnimbleness required.\\nThe climb was exhilarating, easing the fears that had fermented in her\\nbecause of her escort\\'s silent withdrawal and the fact that a precious \\'thopter\\nhad been sent for her. She felt the inner leaping at the nearness of reunion\\nwith Paul-Muad\\'Dib, her Usul. His name might be a battle cry over all the land:\\n\"Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib! Muad\\'Dib!\" But she knew a different man by a different name\\n-- the father of her son, the tender lover.\\nA great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed. She\\nquickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A\\ndim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon.\\nThe figure above was not one of her own escort. Otheym? she wondered,\\nmarking a familiarity of movement and manner. She came up to him, recognized in\\nthe growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood\\nopen and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing\\nout on the desert for only a moment.\\n\"Hurry,\" he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden\\ncave. \"It will be light soon,\" he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her.\\n\"The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region.\\nWe dare not chance discovery now.\"\\nThey emerged into the narrow side-passage entrance to the Cave of Birds.\\nGlowglobes came alight. Otheym pressed past her, said: \"Follow me. Quickly,\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\\x0cThey sped down the passage, through another valve door, another passage and\\nthrough hangings into what had been the Sayyadina\\'s alcove in the days when this\\nwas an overday rest cave. Rugs and cushions now covered the floor. Woven\\nhangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls. A low field desk at\\none side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice\\norigin.\\nThe Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance. She looked up\\nwith the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.\\nOtheym pressed palms together, said: \"I have brought Chani.\" He bowed,\\nretreated through the hangings.\\nAnd Jessica thought: How do I tell Chani?\\n\"How is my grandson?\" Jessica asked.\\nSo it\\'s to be the ritual greeting, Chani thought, and her fears returned.\\nWhere is Muad\\'Dib? Why isn\\'t he here to greet me?\\n\"He is healthy and happy, my mother,\" Chani said. \"I left him with Alia in\\nthe care of Harah.\"\\nMy mother, Jessica thought. Yes, she has the right to call me that in the\\nformal greeting. She has given me a grandson.\\n\"I hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch,\" Jessica said.\\n\"It is lovely cloth,\" Chani said.\\n\"Does Alia send a message?\"\\n\"No message. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are\\nbeginning to accept the miracle of her status.\"\\nWhy does she drag this out so? Chani wondered. Something was so urgent that\\nthey sent a \\'thopter for me. Now, we drag through the formalities!\\n\"We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto,\"\\nJessica said.\\n\"Whatever you wish, my mother,\" Chani said. She lowered her gaze. \"Is there\\nnews of battles?\" She held her face expressionless that Jessica might not see\\nthe betrayal -- that this was a question about Paul Muad\\'Dib.\\n\"New victories,\" Jessica said. \"Rabban has sent cautious overtures about a\\ntruce. His messengers have been returned without their water. Rabban has even\\nlightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages. But he is too\\nlate. \"The people know he does it out of fear of us.\"\\n\"Thus it goes as Muad\\'Dib said,\" Chani said. She stared at Jessica, trying\\nto keep her fears to herself. I have spoken his name, but she has not responded.\\nOne cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face . . . but she is\\ntoo frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?\\n\"I wish we were in the south,\" Jessica said. \"The oases were so beautiful\\nwhen we left. Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?\"\\n\"The land is beautiful, true,\" Chani said. \"But there is much grief in it.\"\\n\"Grief is the price of victory,\" Jessica said.\\nIs she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herself. She said: \"There are so\\nmany women without men. There was jealousy when it was learned that I\\'d been\\nsummoned north.\"\\n\"I summoned you,\" Jessica said.\\nChani felt her heart hammering. She wanted to clap her hands to her ears,\\nfearful of what they might hear. Still, she kept her voice even: \"The message\\nwas signed Muad\\'Dib.\"\\n\"I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants,\" Jessica said. \"It was\\na subterfuge of necessity.\" And Jessica thought: This is a brave woman, my\\nPaul\\'s. She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her.\\nYes. She may be the one we need now.\\nOnly the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chani\\'s voice as she said:\\n\"Now you may say the thing that must be said.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"You were needed here to help me revive Paul,\" Jessica said. And she\\nthought: There! I said it in the precisely correct way. Revive. Thus she knows\\nPaul is alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.\\nChani took only a moment to calm herself, then: \"What is it I may do?\" She\\nwanted to leap at Jessica, shake her and scream: \"Take me to him!\" But she\\nwaited silently for the answer.\\n\"I suspect,\" Jessica said, \"that the Harkonnens have managed to send an\\nagent among us to poison Paul. It\\'s the only explanation that seems to fit. A\\nmost unusual poison. I\\'ve examined his blood in the most subtle ways without\\ndetecting it.\"\\nChani thrust herself forward onto her knees. \"Poison? Is he in pain? Could I\\n. . . \"\\n\"He is unconscious,\" Jessica said. \"The processes of his life are so low\\nthat they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. I shudder to\\nthink what could have happened had I not been the one to discover him. He\\nappears dead to the untrained eye.\"\\n\"You have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me,\" Chani said. \"I know\\nyou, Reverend Mother. What is it you think I may do that you cannot do?\"\\nShe is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive, Jessica thought. She\\'d have\\nmade a fine Bene Gesserit.\\n\"Chani,\" Jessica said, \"you may find this difficult to believe, but I do not\\nknow precisely why I sent for you. It was an instinct . . . a basic intuition.\\nThe thought came unbidden: \\'Send for Chani.\\' \"\\nFor the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica\\'s expression, the\\nunveiled pain modifying the inward stare.\\n\"I\\'ve done all I know to do,\" Jessica said. \"That all . . . it is so far\\nbeyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty imagining\\nit. Yet . . . I failed.\"\\n\"The old companion, Halleck,\" Chani asked, \"is it possible he\\'s a traitor?\"\\n\"Not Gurney,\" Jessica said.\\nThe two words carried an entire conversation, and Chani saw the searching,\\nthe tests . . . the memories of old failures that went into this flat denial.\\nChani rocked back onto her feet, stood up, smoothed her desert-stained robe.\\n\"Take me to him,\" she said.\\nJessica arose, turned through hangings on the left wall.\\nChani followed, found herself in what had been a storeroom, its rock walls\\nconcealed now beneath heavy draperies. Paul lay on a field pad against the far\\nwall. A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face. A black robe covered\\nhim to the chest, leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides. He\\nappeared to be unclothed under the robe. The skin exposed looked waxen, rigid.\\nThere was no visible movement to him.\\nChani suppressed the desire to dash forward, throw herself across him. She\\nfound her thoughts, instead, going to her son -- Leto. And she realized in this\\ninstant that Jessica once had faced such a moment -- her man threatened by\\ndeath, forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young\\nson. The realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani\\nreached out and clasped Jessica\\'s hand. The answering grip was painful in its\\nintensity.\\n\"He lives,\" Jessica said. \"I assure you he lives. But the thread of his life\\nis so thin it could easily escape detection. There are some among the leaders\\nalready muttering that the mother speaks and not the Reverend Mother, that my\\nson is truly dead and I do not want to give up his water to the tribe.\"\\n\"How long has he been this way?\" Chani asked. She disengaged her hand from\\nJessica\\'s, moved farther into the room.\\n\"Three weeks,\" Jessica said. \"I spent almost a week trying to revive him.\\nThere were meetings, arguments . . . investigations. Then I sent for you. The\\n\\n\\x0cFedaykin obey my orders, else I might not have been able to delay the . . . \"\\nShe wet her lips with her tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul.\\nChani stood over him now, looking down on the soft beard of youth that\\nframed his face, tracing with her eyes the high browline, the strong nose, the\\nshuttered eyes -- the features so peaceful in this rigid repose.\\n\"How does he take nourishment?\" Chani asked.\\n\"The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food,\" Jessica\\nsaid.\\n\"How many know of what has happened?\" Chani asked.\\n\"Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of\\ncourse, whoever administered the poison.\"\\n\"There is no clue to the poisoner?\"\\n\"And it\\'s not for want of investigating,\" Jessica said.\\n\"What do the Fedaykin say?\" Chani asked.\\n\"They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers before\\nthe final battles. This is a thought I\\'ve cultivated.\"\\nChani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad, bent close to Paul\\'s\\nface. She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face . . . but it\\nwas only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in\\nFremen life. Still . . .\\n\"You were not born to the spice as we were,\" Chani said. \"Have you\\ninvestigated the possibility that his body has rebelled against too much spice\\nin his diet?\"\\n\"Allergy reactions are all negative,\" Jessica said.\\nShe closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden\\nrealization of fatigue. How long have I been without sleep? she asked herself.\\nToo long.\\n\"When you change the Water of Life,\" Chani said, \"you do it within yourself\\nby the inward awareness. Have you used this awareness to test his blood?\"\\n\"Normal Fremen blood,\" Jessica said. \"Completely adapted to the diet and the\\nlife here.\"\\nChani sat back on her heels, submerging her fears in thought as she studied\\nPaul\\'s face. This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend\\nMothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire\\nattention.\\nPresently, Chani said: \"Is there a maker here?\"\\n\"There are several,\" Jessica said with a touch of weariness. \"We are never\\nwithout them these days. Each victory requires its blessing. Each ceremony\\nbefore a raid --\"\\n\"But Paul Muad\\'Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies,\" Chani\\nsaid.\\nJessica nodded to herself, remembering her son\\'s ambivalent feelings toward\\nthe spice drug and the prescient awareness it precipitated.\\n\"How did you know this?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"It is spoken.\"\\n\"Too much is spoken,\" Jessica said bitterly.\\n\"Get me the raw Water of the maker,\" Chani said.\\nJessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani\\'s voice, then observed the\\nintense concentration in the younger woman and said: \"At once.\" She went out\\nthrough the hangings to send a waterman.\\nChani sat staring at Paul. If he has tried to do this, she thought. And it\\'s\\nthe sort of thing he might try . . .\\nJessica knelt beside Chani, holding out a plain camp ewer. The charged odor\\nof the poison was sharp in Chani\\'s nostrils. She dipped a finger in the fluid,\\nheld the finger close to Paul\\'s nose.\\nThe skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly. Slowly, the\\nnostrils flared.\\n\\n\\x0cJessica gasped.\\nChani touched the dampened finger to Paul\\'s upper lip.\\nHe drew in a long, sobbing breath. \"What is this?\" Jessica demanded.\\n\"Be still,\" Chani said. \"You must convert a small amount of the sacred\\nwater. Quickly!\"\\nWithout questioning, because she recognized the tone of awareness in Chani\\'s\\nvoice, Jessica lifted the ewer to her mouth, drew in a small sip.\\nPaul\\'s eyes flew open. He stared upward at Chani.\\n\"It is not necessary for her to change the Water,\" he said. His voice was\\nweak, but steady.\\nJessica, a sip of the fluid on her tongue, found her body rallying,\\nconverting the poison almost automatically. In the light elevation the ceremony\\nalways imparted, she sensed the life-glow from Paul -- a radiation there\\nregistering on her senses.\\nIn that instant, she knew.\\n\"You drank the sacred water!\" she blurted.\\n\"One drop of it,\" Paul said. \"So small . . . one drop.\"\\n\"How could you do such a foolish thing?\" she demanded.\\n\"He is your son,\" Chani said.\\nJessica glared at her.\\nA rare smile, warm and full of understanding, touched Paul\\'s lips. \"Hear my\\nbeloved,\" he said. \"Listen to her, Mother. She knows.\"\\n\"A thing that others can do, he must do,\" Chani said.\\n\"When I had the drop in my mouth, when I felt it and smelled it, when I knew\\nwhat it was doing to me, then I knew I could do the thing that you have done,\"\\nhe said. \"Your Bene Gesserit proctors speak of the Kwisatz Haderach, but they\\ncannot begin to guess the many places I have been. In the few minutes I . . . \"\\nHe broke off, looking at Chani with a puzzled frown. \"Chani? How did you get\\nhere? You\\'re supposed to be . . . Why are you here?\"\\nHe tried to push himself onto his elbows. Chani pressed him back gently.\\n\"Please, my Usul,\" she said.\\n\"I feel so weak,\" he said. His gaze darted around the room. \"How long have I\\nbeen here?\"\\n\"You\\'ve been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed to\\nhave fled,\" Jessica said.\\n\"But it was . . . I took it just a moment ago and . . . \"\\n\"A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me,\" Jessica said.\\n\"It was only one drop, but I converted it,\" Paul said. \"I changed the Water\\nof Life.\" And before Chani or Jessica could stop him, he dipped his hand into\\nthe ewer they had placed on the floor beside him, and he brought the dripping\\nhand to his mouth, swallowed the palm-cupped liquid.\\n\"Paul!\" Jessica screamed.\\nHe grabbed her hand, faced her with a death\\'s head grin, and he sent his\\nawareness surging over her.\\nThe rapport was not as tender, not as sharing, not as encompassing as it had\\nbeen with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern . . . but it was a\\nrapport: a sense-sharing of the entire being. It shook her, weakened her, and\\nshe cowered in her mind, fearful of him.\\nAloud, he said: \"You speak of a place where you cannot enter? This place\\nwhich the Reverend Mother cannot face, show it to me.\"\\nShe shook her head, terrified by the very thought.\\n\"Show it to me!\" he commanded.\\n\"No!\"\\nBut she could not escape him. Bludgeoned by the terrible force of him, she\\nclosed her eyes and focused inward -- the-direction-that-is-dark.\\nPaul\\'s consciousness flowed through and around her and into the darkness.\\nShe glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself away from the\\n\\n\\x0cterror. Without knowing why, her whole being trembled at what she had seen -- a\\nregion where a wind blew and sparks glared, where rings of light expanded and\\ncontracted, where rows of tumescent white shapes flowed over and under and\\naround the lights, driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere.\\nPresently, she opened her eyes, saw Paul staring up at her. He still held\\nher hand, but the terrible rapport was gone. She quieted her trembling. Paul\\nreleased her hand. It was as though some crutch had been removed. She staggered\\nup and back, would have fallen had not Chani jumped to support her.\\n\"Reverend Mother!\" Chani said. \"What is wrong?\"\\n\"Tired,\" Jessica whispered. \"So . . . tired.\"\\n\"Here,\" Chani said. \"Sit here.\" She helped Jessica to a cushion against the\\nwall.\\nThe strong young arms felt so good to Jessica. She clung to Chani.\\n\"He has, in truth, seen the Water of Life?\" Chani asked. She disengaged\\nherself from Jessica\\'s grip.\\n\"He has seen,\" Jessica whispered. Her mind still rolled and surged from the\\ncontact. It was like stepping to solid land after weeks on a heaving sea. She\\nsensed the old Reverend Mother within her . . . and all the others awakened and\\nquestioning; \"What was that? What happened? Where was that place?\"\\nThrough it all threaded the realization that her son was the Kwisatz\\nHaderach, the one who could be many places at once. He was the fact out of the\\nBene Gesserit dream. And the fact gave her no peace.\\n\"What happened?\" Chani demanded.\\nJessica shook her head.\\nPaul said: \"There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an\\nancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within\\nhimself where the taking force dwells, but it\\'s almost impossible for him to see\\ninto the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a\\nwoman, the situation is reversed.\"\\nJessica looked up, found Chani was staring at her while listening to Paul.\\n\"Do you understand me, Mother?\" Paul asked.\\nShe could only nod.\\n\"These things are so ancient within us,\" Paul said, \"that they\\'re ground\\ninto each separate cell of our bodies. We\\'re shaped by such forces. You can say\\nto yourself, \\'Yes, I see how such a thing may be.\\' But when you look inward and\\nconfront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see\\nthat this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that\\ntakes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives. It\\'s as easy to\\nbe overwhelmed by giving as by taking.\"\\n\"And you, my son,\" Jessica asked, \"are you one who gives or one who takes?\"\\n\"I\\'m at the fulcrum,\" he said. \"I cannot give without taking and I cannot\\ntake without . . . \" He broke off, looking to the wall at his right.\\nChani felt a draft against her cheek, turned to see the hangings close.\\n\"It was Otheym,\" Paul said. \"He was listening.\"\\nAccepting the words, Chani was touched by some of the prescience that\\nhaunted Paul, and she knew a thing-yet-to-be as though it already had occurred.\\nOtheym would speak of what he had seen and heard. Others would spread the story\\nuntil it was a fire over the land. Paul-Muad\\'Dib is not as other men, they would\\nsay. There can be no more doubt. He is a man, yet he sees through to the Water\\nof Life in the way of a Reverend Mother. He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib.\\n\"You have seen the future, Paul,\" Jessica said. \"Will you say what you\\'ve\\nseen?\"\\n\"Not the future,\" he said. \"I\\'ve seen the Now.\" He forced himself to a\\nsitting position, waved Chani aside as she moved to help him. \"The Space above\\nArrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild.\"\\nJessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.\\n\\n\\x0c\"The Padishah Emperor himself is there,\" Paul said. He looked at the rock\\nceiling of his cell. \"With his favorite Truthsayer and five legions of\\nSardaukar. The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with Thufir Hawat beside\\nhim and seven ships jammed with every conscript he could muster. Every Great\\nHouse has its raiders above us . . . waiting.\"\\nChani shook her head, unable to look away from Paul. His strangeness, the\\nflat tone of voice, the way he looked through her, filled her with awe.\\nJessica tried to swallow in a dry throat, said: \"For what are they waiting?\"\\nPaul looked at her. \"For the Guild\\'s permission to land. The Guild will\\nstrand on Arrakis any force that lands without permission.\"\\n\"The Guild\\'s protecting us?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"Protecting us! The Guild itself caused this by spreading tales about what\\nwe do here and by reducing troop transport fares to a point where even the\\npoorest Houses are up there now waiting to loot us.\"\\nJessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone, wondered at it. She\\ncouldn\\'t doubt his words -- they had that same intensity she\\'d seen in him the\\nnight he\\'d revealed the path of the future that\\'d taken them among the Fremen.\\nPaul took a deep breath, said: \"Mother, you must change a quantity of the\\nWater for us. We need the catalyst. Chani, have a scout force sent out . . . to\\nfind a pre-spice mass. If we plant a quantity of the Water of Life above a pre-spice mass, do you know what will happen?\"\\nJessica weighed his words, suddenly saw through to his meaning. \"Paul!\" she\\ngasped.\\n\"The Water of Death,\" he said. \"It\\'d be a chain reaction.\" He pointed to the\\nfloor. \"Spreading death among the little makers, killing a vector of the life\\ncycle that includes the spice and the makers. Arrakis will become a true\\ndesolation -- without spice or maker.\"\\nChani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy\\npouring from Paul\\'s lips.\\n\"He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it,\" Paul said. \"We can\\ndestroy the spice.\"\\n\"What stays the Guild\\'s hand?\" Jessica whispered.\\n\"They\\'re searching for me,\" Paul said. \"Think of that! The finest Guild\\nnavigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for\\nthe fastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me . . .and unable to find me. How\\nthey tremble! They know I have their secret here!\" Paul held out his cupped\\nhand. \"Without the spice they\\'re blind!\"\\nChani found her voice. \"You said you see the now!\"\\nPaul lay back, searching the spread-out present, its limits extended into\\nthe future and into the past, holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the\\nspice illumination began to fade.\\n\"Go do as I commanded,\" he said. \"The future\\'s becoming as muddled for the\\nGuild as it is for me. The lines of vision are narrowing. Everything focuses\\nhere where the spice is . . . where they\\'ve dared not interfere before . . .\\nbecause to interfere was to lose what they must have. But now they\\'re desperate.\\nAll paths lead into darkness.\"\\n', 48: '\\nAnd that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel\\npoised to spin.\\n-from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\"Will you look at that thing!\" Stilgar whispered.\\nPaul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim, eye fixed\\nto the collector of a Fremen telescope. The oil lens was focused on a starship\\nlighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall eastern face of the\\n\\n\\x0cship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow side still showed\\nyellow portholes from glowglobes of the night. Beyond the ship, the city of\\nArrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun.\\nIt wasn\\'t the lighter that excited Stilgar\\'s awe, Paul knew, but the\\nconstruction for which the lighter was only the centerpost. A single metal\\nhutment, many stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle from the base\\nof the lighter -- a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves -- the temporary\\nlodging place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial Majesty, the\\nPadishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\\nFrom his position squatting at Paul\\'s left, Gurney Halleck said: \"I count\\nnine levels to it. Must be quite a few Sardaukar in there.\"\\n\"Five legions,\" Paul said.\\n\"It grows light,\" Stilgar hissed. \"We like it not, your exposing yourself,\\nMuad\\'Dib. Let us go back into the rocks now.\"\\n\"I\\'m perfectly safe here,\" Paul said.\\n\"That ship mounts projectile weapons,\" Gurney said.\\n\"They believe us protected by shields,\" Paul said. \"They wouldn\\'t waste a\\nshot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us.\"\\nPaul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin, seeing the\\npockmarked cliffs, the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his father\\'s\\ntroopers. And he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things that the shades\\nof those men should look down on this moment. The Harkonnen forts and towns\\nacross the shielded lands lay in Fremen hands or cut away from their source like\\nstalks severed from a plant and left to wither. Only this basin and its city\\nremained to the enemy.\\n\"They might try a sortie by \\'thopter,\" Stilgar said. \"If they see us.\"\\n\"Let them,\" Paul said. \"We\\'ve \\'thopters to burn today . . . and we know a\\nstorm is coming.\"\\nHe swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field now, to\\nthe Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company banner waving gently\\nfrom its staff on the ground beneath them. And he thought of the desperation\\nthat had forced the Guild to permit these two groups to land while all the\\nothers were held in reserve. The Guild was like a man testing the sand with his\\ntoe to gauge its temperature before erecting a tent.\\n\"Is there anything new to see from here?\" Gurney asked. \"We should be\\ngetting under cover. The storm is coming.\"\\nPaul returned his attention on the giant hutment. \"They\\'ve even brought\\ntheir women,\" he said. \"And lackeys and servants. Ah-h-h, my dear Emperor, how\\nconfident you are.\"\\n\"Men are coming up the secret way,\" Stilgar said. \"It may be Otheym and\\nKorba returning.\"\\n\"All right, Stil,\" Paul said. \"We\\'ll go back.\"\\nBut he took one final look around through the telescope -- studying the\\nplain with its tall ships, the gleaming metal hutment, the silent city, the\\nfrigates of the Harkonnen mercenaries. Then he slid backward around a scarp of\\nrock. His place at the telescope was taken by a Fedaykin guardsman.\\nPaul emerged into a shallow depression in the Shield Wall\\'s surface. It was\\na place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep, a natural\\nfeature of the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a translucent camouflage\\ncover. Communications equipment was clustered around a hole in the wall to the\\nright. Fedaykin guards deployed through the depression waited for Muad\\'Dib\\'s\\ncommand to attack.\\nTwo men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment, spoke to the\\nguards there.\\nPaul glanced at Stilgar, nodded in the direction of the two men. \"Get their\\nreport, Stil.\"\\nStilgar moved to obey.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul crouched with his back to the rock, stretching his muscles,\\nstraightened. He saw Stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the\\nrock, thought about the long climb down that narrow man-made tunnel to the floor\\nof the basin.\\nStilgar crossed to Paul.\\n\"What was so important that they couldn\\'t send a cielago with the message?\"\\nPaul asked.\\n\"They\\'re saving their birds for the battle,\" Stilgar said. He glanced at the\\ncommunications equipment, back to Paul. \"Even with a tight beam, it is wrong to\\nuse those things, Muad\\'Dib. They can find you by taking a bearing on its\\nemission.\"\\n\"They\\'ll soon be too busy to find me,\" Paul said. \"What did the men report?\"\\n\"Our pet Sardaukar have been released near Old Gap low on the rim and are on\\ntheir way to their master. The rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are\\nin place. The people are deployed as you ordered. It was all routine.\"\\nPaul glanced across the shallow bowl, studying his men in the filtered light\\nadmitted by the camouflage cover. He felt time creeping like an insect working\\nits way across an exposed rock.\\n\"It\\'ll take our Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop\\ncarrier,\" Paul said.\\n\"They are being watched?\"\\n\"They are being watched,\" Stilgar said.\\nBeside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. \"Hadn\\'t we best be getting\\nto a place of safety?\"\\n\"There is no such place,\" Paul said. \"Is the weather report still\\nfavorable?\"\\n\"A great grandmother of a storm coming,\" Stilgar said. \"Can you not feel it,\\nMuad\\'Dib?\"\\n\"The air does feel chancy,\" Paul agreed. \"But I like the certainty of poling\\nthe weather.\"\\n\"The storm\\'ll be here in the hour,\" Stilgar said. He nodded toward the gap\\nthat looked out on the Emperor\\'s hutment and the Harkonnen frigates. \"They know\\nit there, too. Not a \\'thopter in the sky. Everything pulled in and tied down.\\nThey\\'ve had a report on the weather from their friends in space.\"\\n\"Any more probing sorties?\" Paul asked.\\n\"Nothing since the landing last night,\" Stilgar said. \"They know we\\'re here.\\nI think now they wait to choose their own time.\"\\n\"We choose the time,\" Paul said.\\nGurney glanced upward, growled: \"If they let us.\"\\n\"That fleet\\'ll stay in space,\" Paul said.\\nGurney shook his head.\\n\"They have no choice,\" Paul said. \"We can destroy the spice. The Guild dares\\nnot risk that.\"\\n\"Desperate people are the most dangerous,\" Gurney said.\\n\"Are we not desperate?\" Stilgar asked.\\nGurney scowled at him.\\n\"You haven\\'t lived with the Fremen dream,\" Paul cautioned. \"Stil is thinking\\nof all the water we\\'ve spent on bribes, the years of waiting we\\'ve added before\\nArrakis can bloom. He\\'s not --\"\\n\"Arrrgh,\" Gurney scowled.\\n\"Why\\'s he so gloomy?\" Stilgar asked.\\n\"He\\'s always gloomy before a battle,\" Paul said. \"It\\'s the only form of good\\nhumor Gurney allows himself.\"\\nA slow, wolfish grin spread across Gurney\\'s face, the teeth showing white\\nabove the chip cup of his stillsuit. \"It glooms me much to think on all the poor\\nHarkonnen souls we\\'ll dispatch unshriven,\" he said.\\nStilgar chuckled. \"He talks like a Fedaykin.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Gurney was born a death commando,\" Paul said. And he thought: Yes, let them\\noccupy their minds with small talk be fore we test ourselves against that force\\non the plain. He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney, found\\nthat the troubadour-warrior had resumed a brooding scowl.\\n\"Worry saps the strength,\" Paul murmured. \"You told me that once, Gurney.\"\\n\"My Duke,\" Gurney said, \"my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them to\\nblast a hole in the Shield Wall . . . \"\\n\"Those people up there won\\'t use atomics against us,\" Paul said. \"They don\\'t\\ndare . . . and for the same reason that they cannot risk our destroying the\\nsource of the spice.\"\\n\"But the injunction against --\"\\n\"The injunction!\" Paul barked. \"It\\'s fear, not the injunction that keeps the\\nHouses from hurling atomics against each other. The language of the Great\\nConvention is clear enough: \\'Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for\\nplanetary obliteration.\\' We\\'re going to blast the Shield Wall, not humans.\"\\n\"It\\'s too fine a point,\" Gurney said.\\n\"The hair-splitters up there will welcome any point,\" Paul said. \"Let\\'s talk\\nno more about it.\"\\nHe turned away, wishing he actually felt that confident. Presently, he said:\\n\"What about the city people? Are they in position yet?\"\\n\"Yes,\" Stilgar muttered.\\nPaul looked at him. \"What\\'s eating you?\"\\n\"I never knew the city man could be trusted completely,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"I was a city man myself once,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. \"Muad\\'Dib knows I did not\\nmean --\"\\n\"I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn\\'t what you think\\nhe\\'ll do. It\\'s what he actually does. These city people have Fremen blood. It\\'s\\njust that they haven\\'t yet learned how to escape their bondage. We\\'ll teach\\nthem.\"\\nStilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: \"The habits of a lifetime, Muad\\'Dib.\\nOn the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the communities.\"\\nPaul glanced at Gurney, saw him studying Stilgar. \"Tell us, Gurney, why were\\nthe city folk down there driven from their homes by the Sardaukar?\"\\n\"An old trick, my Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees.\"\\n\"It\\'s been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have\\nforgotten how to fight them,\" Paul said. \"The Sardaukar have played into our\\nhands. They grabbed some city women for their sport, decorated their battle\\nstandards with the heads of the men who objected. And they\\'ve built up a fever\\nof hate among people who otherwise would\\'ve looked on the coming battle as no\\nmore than a great inconvenience . . . and the possibility of exchanging one set\\nof masters for another. The Sardaukar recruit for us, Stilgar.\"\\n\"The city people do seem eager,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"Their hate is fresh and clear,\" Paul said. \"That\\'s why we use them as shock\\ntroops.\"\\n\"The slaughter among them will be fearful,\" Gurney said.\\nStilgar nodded agreement.\\n\"They were told the odds,\" Paul said. \"They know every Sardaukar they kill\\nwill be one less for us. You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for.\\nThey\\'ve discovered they\\'re a people. They\\'re awakening.\"\\nA muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope. Paul moved to\\nthe rock slit, asked: \"What is it out there?\"\\n\"A great commotion, Muad\\'Dib,\" the watcher hissed. \"At that monstrous metal\\ntent. A surface car came from Rimwall West and it was like a hawk into a nest of\\nrock partridge.\"\\n\"Our captive Sardaukar have arrived,\" Paul said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"They\\'ve a shield around the entire landing field now,\" the watcher said. \"I\\ncan see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage yard where they kept the\\nspice.\"\\n\"Now they know who it is they fight,\" Gurney said. \"Let the Harkonnen beasts\\ntremble and fret themselves that an Atreides yet lives!\"\\nPaul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope. \"Watch the flagpole atop the\\nEmperor\\'s ship. If my flag is raised there --\"\\n\"It will not be,\" Gurney said.\\nPaul saw the puzzled frown on Stilgar\\'s face, said: \"If the Emperor\\nrecognized my claim, he\\'ll signal by restoring the Atreides flag to Arrakis.\\nWe\\'ll use the second plan then, move only against the Harkonnens. The Sardaukar\\nwill stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves.\"\\n\"I\\'ve no experience with these offworld things,\" Stilgar said. \"I\\'ve heard\\nof them, but it seems unlikely the --\"\\n\"You don\\'t need experience to know what they\\'ll do,\" Gurney said.\\n\"They\\'re sending a new flag up on the tall ship,\" the watcher said. \"The\\nflag is yellow . . . with a black and red circle in the center.\"\\n\"There\\'s a subtle piece of business,\" Paul said. \"The CHOAM Company flag.\"\\n\"It\\'s the same as the flag at the other ships,\" the Fedaykin guard said.\\n\"I don\\'t understand,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"A subtle piece of business indeed,\" Gurney said. \"Had he sent up the\\nAtreides banner, he\\'d have had to live by what that meant. Too many observers\\nabout. He could\\'ve signaled with the Harkonnen flag on his staff -- a flat\\ndeclaration that\\'d have been. But, no -- he sends up the CHOAM rag. He\\'s telling\\nthe people up there . . . \" Gurney pointed toward space. \" . . . where the\\nprofit is. He\\'s saying he doesn\\'t care if it\\'s an Atreides here or not.\"\\n\"How long till the storm strikes the Shield Wall?\" Paul asked.\\nStilgar turned away, consulted one of the Fedaykin in the bowl. Presently,\\nhe returned, said: \"Very soon, Muad\\'Dib. Sooner than we expected. It\\'s a great-great-grandmother of a storm . . . perhaps even more than you wished.\"\\n\"It\\'s my storm,\" Paul said, and saw the silent awe on the faces of the\\nFedaykin who heard him. \"Though it shook the entire world it could not be more\\nthan I wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall full on?\"\\n\"Close enough to make no difference,\" Stilgar said.\\nA courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin, said: \"The\\nSardaukar and Harkonnen patrols are pulling back, Muad\\'Dib.\"\\n\"They expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good\\nvisibility,\" Stilgar Said. \"They think we\\'ll be in the same fix.\"\\n\"Tell our gunners to set their sights well before visibility drops,\" Paul\\nsaid. \"They must knock the nose off every one of those ships as soon as the\\nstorm has destroyed the shields.\" He stepped to the wall of the bowl, pulled\\nback a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at the sky. The horsetail\\ntwistings of blow sand could be seen against the dark of the sky. Paul restored\\nthe cover, said: \"Start sending our men down, Stil.\"\\n\"Will you not go with us?\" Stilgar asked.\\n\"I\\'ll wait here a bit with the Fedaykin,\" Paul said.\\nStilgar gave a knowing shrug toward Gurney, moved to the hole in the rock\\nwall, was lost in its shadows.\\n\"The trigger that blasts the Shield Wall aside, that I leave in your hands,\\nGurney,\" Paul said. \"You will do it?\"\\n\"I\\'ll do it.\"\\nPaul gestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant, said: \"Otheym, start moving the\\ncheck patrols out of the blast area. They must be out of there before the storm\\nstrikes.\"\\nThe man bowed, followed Stilgar.\\n\\n\\x0cGurney leaned in to the rock slit, spoke to the man at the telescope: \"Keep\\nyour attention on the south wall. It\\'ll be completely undefended until we blow\\nit.\"\\n\"Dispatch a cielago with a time signal,\" Paul ordered.\\n\"Some ground cars are moving toward the south wall,\" the man at the\\ntelescope said. \"Some are using projectile weapons, testing. Our people are\\nusing body shields as you commanded. The ground cars have stopped.\"\\nIn the abrupt silence, Paul heard the wind devils playing overhead -- the\\nfront of the storm. Sand began to drift down into their bowl through gaps in the\\ncover. A burst of wind caught the cover, whipped it away.\\nPaul motioned his Fedaykin to take shelter, crossed to the men at the\\ncommunications equipment near the tunnel mouth. Gurney stayed beside him. Paul\\ncrouched over the signalmen.\\nOne said: \"A great-great-great grandmother of a storm, Muad\\'Dib.\"\\nPaul glanced up at the darkening sky, said: \"Gurney, have the south wall\\nobservers pulled out.\" He had to repeat his order, shouting above the growing\\nnoise of the storm.\\nGurney turned to obey.\\nPaul fastened his face filter, tightened the stillsuit hood.\\nGurney returned.\\nPaul touched his shoulder, pointed to the blast trigger set into the tunnel\\nmouth beyond the signalmen. Gurney went into the tunnel, stopped there, one hand\\nat the trigger, his gaze on Paul.\\n\"We are getting no messages,\" the signalman beside Paul said. \"Much static.\"\\nPaul nodded, kept his eye on the time-standard dial in front of the\\nsignalman. Presently, Paul looked at Gurney, raised a hand, returned his\\nattention to the dial. The time counter crawled around its final circuit.\\n\"Now!\" Paul shouted, and dropped his hand.\\nGurney depressed the blast trigger.\\nIt seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath them\\nripple and shake. A rumbling sound was added to the storm\\'s roar.\\nThe Fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside Paul, the telescope\\nclutched under one arm. \"The Shield Wall is breached, Muad\\'Dib!\" he shouted.\\n\"The storm is on them and our gunners already are firing.\"\\nPaul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin, the static charge\\nwithin the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy camp.\\n\"The storm!\" someone shouted. \"We must get under cover, Muad\\'Dib!\"\\nPaul came to his senses, feeling the sand needles sting his exposed cheeks.\\nWe are committed, he thought. He put an arm around the signalman\\'s shoulder,\\nsaid: \"Leave the equipment! There\\'s more in the tunnel.\" He felt himself being\\npulled away, Fedaykin pressed around him to protect him. They squeezed into the\\ntunnel mouth, feeling its comparative silence, turned a corner into a small\\nchamber with glowglobes overhead and another tunnel opening beyond.\\nAnother signalman sat there at his equipment.\\n\"Much static,\" the man said.\\nA swirl of sand filled the air around them.\\n\"Seal off this tunnel!\" Paul shouted. A sudden pressure of stillness showed\\nthat his command had been obeyed. \"Is the way down to the basin still open?\"\\nPaul asked.\\nA Fedaykin went to look, returned, said: \"The explosion caused a little rock\\nto fall, but the engineers say it is still open. They\\'re cleaning up with\\nlasbeams.\"\\n\"Tell them to use their hands!\" Paul barked. \"There are shields active down\\nthere?\"\\n\"They are being careful, Muad\\'Dib,\" the man said, but he turned to obey.\\nThe signalmen from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment.\\n\"I told those men to leave their equipment!\" Paul said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Fremen do not like to abandon equipment, Muad\\'Dib,\" one of his Fedaykin\\nchided.\\n\"Men are more important than equipment now,\" Paul said. \"We\\'ll have more\\nequipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment.\"\\nGurney Halleck came up beside him, said: \"I heard them say the way down is\\nopen. We\\'re very close to the surface here, m\\'Lord, should the Harkonnens try to\\nretaliate in kind.\"\\n\"They\\'re in no position to retaliate,\" Paul said. \"They\\'re just now finding\\nout that they have no shields and are unable to get off Arrakis.\"\\n\"The new command post is all prepared, though, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said.\\n\"They\\'ve no need of me in the command post yet,\" Paul said. \"The plan would\\ngo ahead without me. We must wait for the --\"\\n\"I\\'m getting a message, Muad\\'Dib,\" said the signalman at the communications\\nequipment. The man shook his head, pressed a receiver phone against his ear.\\n\"Much static!\" He began scribbling on a pad in front of him, shaking his head\\nwaiting, writing . . . waiting.\\nPaul crossed to the signalman\\'s side. The Fedaykin stepped back, giving him\\nroom. He looked down at what the man had written, read:\\n\"Raid . . . on Sietch Tabr . . . captives . . . Alia (blank) families of\\n(blank) dead are . . . they (blank) son of Muad\\'Dib . . . \"\\nAgain, the signalman shook his head.\\nPaul looked up to see Gurney staring at him.\\n\"The message is garbled,\" Gurney said. \"The static. You don\\'t know that . .\\n. \"\\n\"My son is dead,\" Paul said, and knew as he spoke that it was true. \"My son\\nis dead . . . and Alia is a captive . . . hostage.\" He felt emptied, a shell\\nwithout emotions. Everything he touched brought death and grief. And it was like\\na disease that could spread across the universe.\\nHe could feel the old-man wisdom, the accumulation out of the experiences\\nfrom countless possible lives. Something seemed to chuckle and rub its hands\\nwithin him.\\nAnd Paul thought: How little the universe knows about the nature of real\\ncruelty!\\n', 49: '\\nAnd Muad\\'Dib stood before them, and he said: \"Though we deem the captive dead,\\nyet does she live. For her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice. And she\\nsees unto the farthest reaches of possibility. Yea, unto the vale of the\\nunknowable does she see because of me.\"\\n-from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood with eyes downcast in the Imperial\\naudience chamber, the oval selamlik within the Padishah Emperor\\'s hutment. With\\ncovert glances, the Baron had studied the metal-walled room and its occupants -the noukkers, the pages, the guards, the troop of House Sardaukar drawn up\\naround the walls, standing at ease there beneath the bloody and tattered\\ncaptured battle flags that were the room\\'s only decoration.\\nVoices sounded from the right of the chamber, echoing out of a high passage:\\n\"Make way! Make way for the Royal Person!\"\\nThe Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV came out of the passage into the audience\\nchamber followed by his suite. He stood waiting while his throne was brought,\\nignoring the Baron, seemingly ignoring every person in the room.\\nThe Baron found that he could not ignore the Royal Person, and studied the\\nEmperor for a sign, any clue to the purpose of this audience. The Emperor stood\\npoised, waiting -- a slim, elegant figure in a gray Sardaukar uniform with\\nsilver and gold trim. His thin face and cold eyes reminded the Baron of the Duke\\n\\n\\x0cLeto long dead. There was that same look of the predatory bird. But the\\nEmperor\\'s hair was red, not black, and most of that hair was concealed by a\\nBurseg\\'s ebon helmet with the Imperial crest in gold upon its crown.\\nPages brought the throne. It was a massive chair carved from a single piece\\nof Hagal quartz -- blue-green translucency shot through with streaks of yellow\\nfire. They placed it on the dais and the Emperor mounted, seated himself.\\nAn old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead\\ndetached herself from the Emperor\\'s suite, took up station behind the throne,\\none scrawny hand resting on the quartz back. Her face peered out of the hood\\nlike a witch caricature -- sunken cheeks and eyes, an overlong nose, skin\\nmottled and with protruding veins.\\nThe Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her. The presence of the\\nReverend Mother Gains Helen Mohiam, the Emperor\\'s Truthsayer, betrayed the\\nimportance of this audience. The Baron looked away from her, studied the suite\\nfor a clue. There were two of the Guild agents, one tall and fat, one short and\\nfat, both with bland gray eyes. And among the lackeys stood one of the Emperor\\'s\\ndaughters, the Princess Irulan, a woman they said was being trained in the\\ndeepest of the Bene Gesserit ways, destined to be a Reverend Mother. She was\\ntall, blonde, face of chiseled beauty, green eyes that looked past and through\\nhim.\\n\"My dear Baron.\"\\nThe Emperor had deigned to notice him. The voice was baritone and with\\nexquisite control. It managed to dismiss him while greeting him.\\nThe Baron bowed low, advanced to the required position ten paces from the\\ndais. \"I came at your summons, Majesty.\"\\n\"Summons!\" the old witch cackled.\\n\"Now, Reverend Mother,\" the Emperor chided, but he smiled at the Baron\\'s\\ndiscomfiture, said: \"First, you will tell me where you\\'ve sent your minion,\\nThufir Hawat.\"\\nThe Baron darted his gaze left and right, reviled himself for coming here\\nwithout his own guards, not that they\\'d be much use against Sardaukar. Still . .\\n.\\n\"Well?\" the Emperor said.\\n\"He has been gone these five days, Majesty.\" The Baron shot a glance at the\\nGuild agents, back to the Emperor. \"He was to land at a smuggler base and\\nattempt infiltrating the camp of the Fremen fanatic, this Muad\\'Dib.\"\\n\"Incredible!\" the Emperor said.\\nOne of the witch\\'s clawlike hands tapped the Emperor\\'s shoulder. She leaned\\nforward, whispered in his ear.\\nThe Emperor nodded, said: \"Five days, Baron. Tell me, why aren\\'t you worried\\nabout his absence?\"\\n\"But I am worried, Majesty!\"\\nThe Emperor continued to stare at him, waiting. The Reverend Mother emitted\\na cackling laugh.\\n\"What I mean, Majesty,\" the Baron said, \"is that Hawat will be dead within\\nanother few hours, anyway.\" And he explained about the latent poison and need\\nfor an antidote.\\n\"How clever of you, Baron,\" the Emperor said. \"And where are your nephews,\\nRabban and the young Feyd-Rautha?\"\\n\"The storm comes, Majesty. I sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the\\nFremen attack under cover of the sand.\"\\n\"Perimeter,\" the Emperor said. The word came out as though it puckered his\\nmouth. \"The storm won\\'t be much here in the basin, and that Fremen rabble won\\'t\\nattack while I\\'m here with five legions of Sardaukar.\"\\n\"Surely not, Majesty,\" the Baron said, \"But error on the side of caution\\ncannot be censured.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Ah-h-h-h,\" the Emperor said. \"Censure. Then I\\'m not to speak of how much\\ntime this Arrakis nonsense has taken from me? Nor the CHOAM Company profits\\npouring down this rat hole? Nor the court functions and affairs of state I\\'ve\\nhad to delay -- even cancel -- because of this stupid affair?\"\\nThe Baron lowered his gaze, frightened by the Imperial anger. The delicacy\\nof his position here, alone and dependent upon the Convention and the dictum\\nfamilia of the Great Houses, fretted him. Does he mean to kill me? the Baron\\nasked himself. He couldn\\'t! Not with the other Great Houses waiting up there,\\naching for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis.\\n\"Have you taken hostages?\" the Emperor asked.\\n\"It\\'s useless, Majesty,\" the Baron said. \"These mad Fremen hold a burial\\nceremony for every captive and act as though such a one were already dead.\"\\n\"So?\" the Emperor said.\\nAnd the Baron waited, glancing left and right at the metal walls of the\\nselamlik, thinking of the monstrous fanmetal tent around him. Such unlimited\\nwealth it represented that even the Baron was awed. He brings pages, the Baron\\nthought, and useless court lackeys, his women and their companions -- hairdressers, designers, everything . . . all the fringe parasites of the Court. All\\nhere -- fawning, slyly plotting, \"roughing it\" with the Emperor . . . here to\\nwatch him put an end to this affair, to make epigrams over the battles and\\nidolize the wounded.\\n\"Perhaps you\\'ve never sought the right kind of hostages,\" the Emperor said.\\nHe knows something, the Baron thought. Fear sat like a stone in his stomach\\nuntil he could hardly bear the thought of eating. Yet, the feeling was like\\nhunger, and he poised himself several times in his suspensors on the point of\\nordering food brought to him. But there was no one here to obey his summons.\\n\"Do you have any idea who this Muad\\'Dib could be?\" the Emperor asked.\\n\"One of the Umma, surely,\" the Baron said. \"A Fremen fanatic, a religious\\nadventurer. They crop up regularly on the fringes of civilization. Your Majesty\\nknows this.\"\\nThe Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer, turned back to scowl at the Baron.\\n\"And you have no other knowledge of this Muad\\'Dib?\"\\n\"A madman,\" the Baron said. \"But all Fremen are a little mad.\"\\n\"Mad?\"\\n\"His people scream his name as they leap into battle. The women throw their\\nbabies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to open a wedge for their men\\nto attack us. They have no . . . no . . . decency!\"\\n\"As bad as that,\" the Emperor murmured, and his tone of derision did not\\nescape the Baron. \"Tell me, my dear Baron, have you investigated the southern\\npolar regions of Arrakis?\"\\nThe Baron stared up at the Emperor, shocked by the change of subject. \"But .\\n. . well, you know, Your Majesty, the entire region is uninhabitable, open to\\nwind and worm. There\\'s not even any spice in those latitudes.\"\\n\"You\\'ve had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery appear\\nthere?\"\\n\"There\\'ve always been such reports. Some were investigated -- long ago. A\\nfew plants were seen. Many \\'thopters were lost. Much too costly, Your Majesty.\\nIt\\'s a place where men cannot survive for long.\"\\n\"So,\" the Emperor said. He snapped his fingers and a door opened at his left\\nbehind the throne. Through the door came two Sardaukar herding a girl-child who\\nappeared to be about four years old. She wore a black aba, the hood thrown back\\nto reveal the attachments of a stillsuit hanging free at her throat. Her eyes\\nwere Fremen blue, staring out of a soft, round face. She appeared completely\\nunafraid and there was a look to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for\\nno reason he could explain.\\n\\n\\x0cEven the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made\\na warding sign in her direction. The old witch obviously was shaken by the\\nchild\\'s presence.\\nThe Emperor cleared his throat to speak, but the child spoke first -- a thin\\nvoice with traces of a soft-palate lisp, but clear nonetheless. \"So here he is,\"\\nshe said. She advanced to the edge of the dais. \"He doesn\\'t appear much, does he\\n-- one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help\\nof suspensors.\"\\nIt was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child that\\nthe Baron stared at her, speechless in spite of his anger. Is it a midget? he\\nasked himself.\\n\"My dear Baron,\" the Emperor said, \"become acquainted with the sister of\\nMuad\\'Dib.\"\\n\"The sist . . . \"The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor. \"I do not\\nunderstand.\"\\n\"I, too, sometimes err on the side of caution,\" the Emperor said. \"It has\\nbeen reported to me that your uninhabited south polar regions exhibit evidence\\nof human activity.\"\\n\"But that\\'s impossible!\" the Baron protested. \"The worms . . . there\\'s sand\\nclear to the . . . \"\\n\"These people seem able to avoid the worms,\" the Emperor said.\\nThe child sat down on the dais beside the throne, dangled her feet over the\\nedge, kicking them. There was such an air of sureness in the way she appraised\\nher surroundings.\\nThe Baron stared at the kicking feet, the way they moved the black robe, the\\nwink of sandals beneath the fabric.\\n\"Unfortunately,\" the Emperor said, \"I only sent in five troop carriers with\\na light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away\\nwith three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost\\noverwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men. This\\nchild here was in command of one of the attacking groups.\"\\n\"You see, Your Majesty!\" the Baron said. \"You see how they are!\"\\n\"I allowed myself to be captured,\" the child said. \"I did not want to face\\nmy brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed.\"\\n\"Only a handful of our men got away,\" the Emperor said. \"Got away! You hear\\nthat?\"\\n\"We\\'d have had them, too,\" the child said, \"except for the flames.\"\\n\"My Sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as flame-throwers,\"\\nthe Emperor said. \"A move of desperation and the only thing that got them away\\nwith their three prisoners. Mark that, my dear Baron: Sardaukar forced to\\nretreat in confusion from women and children and old men!\"\\n\"We must attack in force,\" the Baron rasped. \"We must destroy every last\\nvestige of --\"\\n\"Silence!\" the Emperor roared. He pushed himself forward on his throne. \"Do\\nnot abuse my intelligence any longer. You stand there in your foolish innocence\\nand --\"\\n\"Majesty,\" the old Truthsayer said.\\nHe waved her to silence. \"You say you don\\'t know about the activity we\\nfound, nor the fighting qualities of these superb people!\" The Emperor lifted\\nhimself half off his throne. \"What do you take me for, Baron?\"\\nThe Baron took two backward steps, thinking: It was Rabban. He has done this\\nto me. Rabban has . . .\\n\"And this fake dispute with Duke Leto,\" the Emperor purred, sinking back\\ninto his throne. \"How beautifully you maneuvered it.\"\\n\"Majesty,\" the Baron pleaded. \"What are you --\"\\n\"Silence!\"\\n\\n\\x0cThe old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor\\'s shoulder, leaned close to\\nwhisper in his ear.\\nThe child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet, said: \"Make him\\nafraid some more, Shaddam. I shouldn\\'t enjoy this, but I find the pleasure\\nimpossible to suppress.\"\\n\"Quiet, child,\" the Emperor said. He leaned forward, put a hand on her head,\\nstared at the Baron. \"Is it possible, Baron? Could you be as simpleminded as my\\nTruthsayer suggests? Do you not recognize this child, daughter of your ally,\\nDuke Leto?\"\\n\"My father was never his ally,\" the child said. \"My father is dead and this\\nold Harkonnen beast has never seen me before.\"\\nThe Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it was\\nonly to rasp: \"Who?\"\\n\"I am Alia, daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister of Duke Paul-Muad\\'Dib,\" the child said. She pushed herself off the dais, dropped to the floor\\nof the audience chamber. \"My brother has promised to have your head atop his\\nbattle standard and I think he shall.\"\\n\"Be hush, child,\" the Emperor said, and he sank back into his throne, hand\\nto chin, studying the Baron.\\n\"I do not take the Emperor\\'s orders,\" Alia said. She turned, looked up at\\nthe old Reverend Mother. \"She knows.\"\\nThe Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer. \"What does she mean?\"\\n\"That child is an abomination!\" the old woman said. \"Her mother deserves a\\npunishment greater than anything in history. Death! It cannot come too quickly\\nfor that child or for the one who spawned her!\" The old woman pointed a finger\\nat Alia. \"Get out of my mind!\"\\n\"T-P?\" the Emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. \"By the\\nGreat Mother!\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand. Majesty,\" the old woman said. \"Not telepathy. She\\'s\\nin my mind. She\\'s like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories.\\nShe stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!\"\\n\"What others?\" the Emperor demanded. \"What\\'s this nonsense?\"\\nThe old woman straightened, lowered her pointing hand. \"I\\'ve said too much,\\nbut the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long\\nwere we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of\\nour own has betrayed us.\"\\n\"You babble, old woman,\" Alia said. \"You don\\'t know how it was, yet you\\nrattle on like a purblind fool.\" Alia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and\\nheld it.\\nThe old Reverend Mother groaned and staggered.\\nAlia opened her eyes. \"That is how it was,\" she said. \"A cosmic accident . .\\n. and you played your part in it.\"\\nThe Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushing the air toward Alia.\\n\"What is happening here?\" the Emperor demanded. \"Child, can you truly\\nproject your thoughts into the mind of another?\"\\n\"That\\'s not how it is at all,\" Alia said. \"Unless I\\'m born as you, I cannot\\nthink as you.\"\\n\"Kill her,\" the old woman muttered, and clutched the back of the throne for\\nsupport. \"Kill her!\" The sunken old eyes glared at Alia.\\n\"Silence,\" the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. \"Child, can you\\ncommunicate with your brother?\"\\n\"My brother knows I\\'m here,\" Alia said.\\n\"Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?\"\\nAlia smiled up at him with clear innocence. \"I shall not do that,\" she said.\\nThe Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia. \"Majesty,\" he pleaded, \"I\\nknew nothing of --\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Interrupt me once more, Baron,\" the Emperor said, \"and you will lose the\\npowers of interruption . . . forever.\" He kept his attention focused on Alia,\\nstudying her through slitted lids. \"You will not, eh? Can you read in my mind\\nwhat I\\'ll do if you disobey me?\"\\n\"I\\'ve already said I cannot read minds,\" she said, \"but one doesn\\'t need\\ntelepathy to read your intentions.\"\\nThe Emperor scowled. \"Child, your cause is hopeless. I have but to rally my\\nforces and reduce this planet to --\"\\n\"It\\'s not that simple,\" Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. \"Ask\\nthem.\"\\n\"It is not wise to go against my desires,\" the Emperor said. \"You should not\\ndeny me the least thing.\"\\n\"My brother comes now,\" Alia said. \"Even an Emperor may tremble before\\nMuad\\'Dib, for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him.\"\\nThe Emperor surged to his feet. \"This play has gone far enough. I will take\\nyour brother and this planet and grind them to --\"\\nThe room rumbled and shook around them. There came a sudden cascade of sand\\nbehind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the Emperor\\'s ship. The\\nabrupt flicker-tightening of skin pressure told of a wide-area shield being\\nactivated.\\n\"I told you,\" Alia said. \"My brother comes.\"\\nThe Emperor stood in front of his throne, right hand pressed to right ear,\\nthe servo-receiver there chattering its report on the situation. The Baron moved\\ntwo steps behind Alia. Sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors.\\n\"We will fall back into space and reform,\" the Emperor said. \"Baron, my\\napologies. These madmen are attacking under cover of the storm. We will show\\nthem an Emperor\\'s wrath, then.\" He pointed at Alia. \"Give her body to the\\nstorm.\"\\nAs he spoke, Alia fled backward, feigning terror: \"Let the storm have what\\nit can take!\" she screamed. And she backed into the Baron\\'s arms.\\n\"I have her, Majesty!\" the Baron shouted. \"Shall I dispatch her noweeeeeeeeeeeh!\" He hurled her to the floor, clutched his left arm.\\n\"I\\'m sorry, Grandfather,\" Alia said. \"You\\'ve met the Atreides gom jabbar.\"\\nShe got to her feet, dropped a dark needle from her hand.\\nThe Baron fell back. His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left\\npalm. \"You . . . you . . . \" He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging\\nmass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging\\nopen.\\n\"These people are insane,\" the Emperor snarled. \"Quick! Into the ship. We\\'ll\\npurge this planet of every . . . \"\\nSomething sparkled to his left. A roll of ball lightning bounced away from\\nthe wall there, crackled as it touched the metal floor. The smell of burned\\ninsulation swept through the selamlik.\\n\"The shield!\" one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. \"The outer shield is\\ndown! They . . . \"\\nHis words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the\\nEmperor trembled and rocked.\\n\"They\\'ve shot the nose off our ship!\" someone called.\\nDust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward\\nthe outer door.\\nThe Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung\\nopen in the ship\\'s side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a\\nSardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. \"We will make our stand here!\"\\nthe Emperor ordered.\\nAnother crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far\\nside of the chamber admitting wind-blown sand and the sound of shouting. A\\nsmall, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light -- Alia\\n\\n\\x0cdarting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill\\nHarkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened\\nyellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect\\nthe Emperor\\'s retreat.\\n\"Save yourself, Sire!\" a Sardaukar officer shouted. \"Into the ship!\"\\nBut the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors. A\\nforty-meter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the\\nselamlik\\'s doors opened now onto drifting sand. A dust cloud hung low over the\\noutside world blowing from pastel distances. Static lightning crackled from the\\ncloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted out by the storm\\'s charge\\ncould be seen through the haze. The plain surged with figures in combat -Sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed men who seemed to come down out of the\\nstorm.\\nAll this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor\\'s pointing hand.\\nOut of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes -- great rising\\ncurves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of sandworms, a\\nmassed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack. They came\\nin a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on\\nthe plain.\\nOnward toward the Emperor\\'s hutment they came while the House Sardaukar\\nstood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their minds found\\ndifficult to accept.\\nBut the figures leaping from the worm backs were men, and the blades\\nflashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had been\\ntrained to face. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man to man on the\\nplain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar bodyguard pressed the Emperor back\\ninto the ship, sealed the door on him, and prepared to die at that door as part\\nof his shield.\\nIn the shock of comparative silence within the ship, the Emperor stared at\\nthe wide-eyed faces of his suite, seeing his oldest daughter with the flush of\\nexertion on her cheeks, the old Truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her\\nhood pulled about her face, finding at last the faces he sought -- the two\\nGuildsmen. They wore the Guild gray, unadorned, and it seemed to fit the calm\\nthey maintained despite the high emotions around them.\\nThe taller of the two, though, held a hand to his left eye. As the Emperor\\nwatched, someone jostled the Guildsman\\'s arm, the hand moved, and the eye was\\nrevealed. The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses, and the eye stared\\nout a total blue so dark as to be almost black.\\nThe smaller of the pair elbowed his way a step nearer the Emperor, said: \"We\\ncannot know how it will go.\" And the taller companion, hand restored to eye,\\nadded in a cold voice: \"But this Muad\\'Dib cannot know, either.\"\\nThe words shocked the Emperor out of his daze. He checked the scorn on his\\ntongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild navigator\\'s single-minded focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain.\\nWere these two so dependent upon their faculty that they had lost the use of\\ntheir eyes and their reason? he wondered.\\n\"Reverend Mother,\" he said, \"we must devise a plan.\"\\nShe pulled the hood from her face, met his gaze with an unblinking stare.\\nThe look that passed between them carried complete understanding. They had one\\nweapon left and both knew it: treachery.\\n\"Summon Count Fenring from his quarters,\" the Reverend Mother said.\\nThe Padishah Emperor nodded, waved for one of his aides to obey that\\ncommand.\\n', 50: '\\n\\n\\x0cHe was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous,\\nruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad\\'Dib\\'s\\nmotives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death\\nprepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of\\na sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad\\'Dib\\nwho ordered battle drums made from his enemies\\' skins, the Muad\\'Dib who denied\\nthe conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: \"I am\\nthe Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough. \"\\n-from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\\nIt was to the Arrakeen governor\\'s mansion, the old Residency the Atreides\\nhad first occupied on Dune, that they escorted Paul-Muad\\'Dib on the evening of\\nhis victory. The building stood as Rabban had restored it, virtually untouched\\nby the fighting although there had been looting by townspeople. Some of the\\nfurnishings in the main hall had been overturned or smashed.\\nPaul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a pace\\nbehind. Their escort fanned out into the Great Hall, straightening the place and\\nclearing an area for Muad\\'Dib. One squad began investigating that no sly trap\\nhad been planted here.\\n\"I remember the day we first came here with your father,\" Gurney said. He\\nglanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. \"I didn\\'t like this\\nplace then and I like it less now. One of our caves would be safer.\"\\n\"Spoken like a true Fremen,\" Stilgar said, and he marked the cold smile that\\nhis words brought to Muad\\'Dib\\'s lips. \"Will you reconsider, Muad\\'Dib?\"\\n\"This place is a symbol,\" Paul said. \"Rabban lived here. By occupying this\\nplace I seal my victory for all to understand. Send men through the building.\\nTouch nothing. Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys remain.\"\\n\"As you command,\" Stilgar said, and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he\\nturned to obey.\\nCommunications men hurried into the room with their equipment, began setting\\nup near the massive fireplace. The Fremen guard that augmented the surviving\\nFedaykin took up stations around the room. There was muttering among them, much\\ndarting of suspicious glances. This had been too long a place of the enemy for\\nthem to accept their presence in it casually.\\n\"Gurney, have an escort bring my mother and Chani,\" Paul said. \"Does Chani\\nknow yet about our son?\"\\n\"The message was sent, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet?\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord. The storm\\'s almost spent.\"\\n\"What\\'s the extent of the storm damage?\" Paul asked.\\n\"In the direct path -- on the landing field and across the spice storage\\nyards of the plain -- extensive damage,\" Gurney said. \"As much from battle as\\nfrom the storm.\"\\n\"Nothing money won\\'t repair, I presume,\" Paul said.\\n\"Except for the lives, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said, and there was a tone of\\nreproach in his voice as though to say: \"When did an Atreides worry first about\\nthings when people were at stake?\"\\nBut Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps\\nvisible to him in the time-wall that still lay across his path. Through each gap\\nthe jihad raged away down the corridors of the future.\\nHe sighed, crossed the hall, seeing a chair against the wall. The chair had\\nonce stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father. At the\\nmoment, though, it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from\\nthe men. He sat down, pulling his robes around his legs, loosening his stillsuit\\nat the neck.\\n\"The Emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship,\" Gurney said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"For now, contain him there,\" Paul said. \"Have they found the Harkonnens\\nyet?\"\\n\"They\\'re still examining the dead.\"\\n\"What reply from the ships up there?\" He jerked his chin toward the ceiling.\\n\"No reply yet, m\\'Lord.\"\\nPaul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said:\\n\"Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We must send a message to our Emperor, It\\'s time\\nto discuss terms.\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\nGurney turned away, dropped a hand signal to one of the Fedaykin who took up\\nclose-guard position beside Paul.\\n\"Gurney,\" Paul whispered. \"Since we\\'ve been rejoined I\\'ve yet to hear you\\nproduce the proper quotation for the event.\" He turned, saw Gurney swallow, saw\\nthe sudden grim hardening of the man\\'s jaw.\\n\"As you wish, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said. He cleared his throat, rasped: \" \\'And\\nthe victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the\\npeople heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.\\' \"\\nPaul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as he\\nhad once waited to mourn his father. Now, he gave his thoughts over to this\\nday\\'s accumulated discoveries -- the mixed futures and the hidden presence of\\nAlia within his awareness.\\nOf all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. \"I have breasted the\\nfuture to place my words where only you can hear them,\" Alia had said. \"Even you\\ncannot do that, my brother. I find it an interesting play. And . . . oh, yes -I\\'ve killed our grandfather, the demented old Baron. He had very little pain.\"\\nSilence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal.\\n\"Muad\\'Dib.\"\\nPaul opened his eyes to see Stilgar\\'s black-bearded visage above him, the\\ndark eyes glaring with battle light.\\n\"You\\'ve found the body of the old Baron,\" Paul said.\\nA hush of the person settled over Stilgar. \"How could you know?\" he\\nwhispered. \"We just found the body in that great pile of metal the Emperor\\nbuilt.\"\\nPaul ignored the question, seeing Gurney return accompanied by two Fremen\\nwho supported a captive Sardaukar.\\n\"Here\\'s one of them, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said. He signed to the guard to hold\\nthe captive five paces in front of Paul.\\nThe Sardaukar\\'s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A\\nblue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He\\nwas of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with\\nrank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except\\nthe gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers.\\n\"I think this one\\'s an officer, m\\'Lord,\" Gurney said.\\nPaul nodded, said: \"I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that,\\nman?\"\\nThe Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.\\n\"Speak up,\" Paul said, \"or your Emperor may die.\"\\nThe man blinked, swallowed.\\n\"Who am I?\" Paul demanded.\\n\"You are the Duke Paul Atreides,\" the man husked.\\nHe seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been\\nprepared for such happenings as this day. They\\'d never known anything but\\nvictory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness in itself. He put that thought\\naside for later consideration in his own training program.\\n\"I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor,\" Paul said. And he\\ncouched his words in the ancient formula: \"I, a Duke of a Great House, an\\nImperial Kinsman, give my word of bond under the Convention. If the Emperor and\\n\\n\\x0chis people lay down their arms and come to me here I will guard their lives with\\nmy own.\" Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the Sardaukar to\\nsee. \"I swear it by this.\"\\nThe man wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Gurney.\\n\"Yes,\" Paul said. \"Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of\\nGurney Halleck.\"\\n\"I will carry the message,\" the Sardaukar said.\\n\"Take him to our forward command post and send him in,\" Paul said.\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\" Gurney motioned for the guard to obey, led them out.\\nPaul turned back to Stilgar.\\n\"Chani and your mother have arrived,\" Stilgar said. \"Chani has asked time to\\nbe alone with her grief. The Reverend Mother sought a moment in the weirding\\nroom; I know not why.\"\\n\"My mother\\'s sick with longing for a planet she may never see,\" Paul said.\\n\"Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you cannot walk\\nbetween them.\"\\n\"Water from the sky,\" Stilgar whispered.\\nIn that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen\\nnaib to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It\\nwas a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it.\\nI have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.\\nIn a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room, noting how proper and\\non-review his guards had become in his presence. He sensed the subtle, prideful\\ncompetition among them -- each hoping for notice from Muad\\'Dib.\\nMuad\\'Dib from whom all blessings flow, he thought, and it was the bitterest\\nthought of his life. They sense that I must take the throne, he thought. But\\nthey cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad.\\nStilgar cleared his throat, said: \"Rabban, too, is dead.\"\\nPaul nodded.\\nGuards to the right suddenly snapped aside, standing at attention to open an\\naisle for Jessica. She wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding\\nacross sand, but Paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what\\nshe had once been here -- concubine to a ruling duke. Her presence carried some\\nof its old assertiveness.\\nJessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his fatigue\\nand how he hid it, but found no compassion for him. It was as though she had\\nbeen rendered incapable of any emotion for her son.\\nJessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to fit\\nitself snugly in to her memories. It remained a foreign room, as though she had\\nnever walked here, never walked here with her beloved Leto, never confronted a\\ndrunken Duncan Idaho here -- never, never, never . . .\\nThere should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding\\nmemory, she thought. There should be a word for memories that deny themselves.\\n\"Where is Alia?\" she asked.\\n\"Out doing what any good Fremen child should be doing in such times,\" Paul\\nsaid. \"She\\'s killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the water-recovery teams.\"\\n\"Paul!\"\\n\"You must understand that she does this out of kindness,\" he said. \"Isn\\'t it\\nodd how we misunderstand the hidden unity of kindness and cruelty?\"\\nJessica glared at her son, shocked by the profound change in him. Was it his\\nchild\\'s death did this? she wondered. And she said: \"The men tell strange\\nstories of you, Paul. They say you\\'ve all the powers of the legend -- nothing\\ncan be hidden from you, that you see where others cannot see.\"\\n\"A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends?\" he asked.\\n\"I\\'ve had a hand in whatever you are,\" she admitted, \"but you mustn\\'t expect\\nme to --\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives?\" Paul asked.\\n\"There\\'s a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those experiences, the wisdom\\nthey\\'d bring. But wisdom tempers love, doesn\\'t it? And it puts a new shape on\\nhate. How can you tell what\\'s ruthless unless you\\'ve plumbed the depths of both\\ncruelty and kindness? You should fear me, Mother. I am the Kwisatz Haderach.\"\\nJessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said; \"Once you\\ndenied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach.\"\\nPaul shook his head. \"I can deny nothing any more.\" He looked up into her\\neyes. \"The Emperor and his people come now. They will be announced any moment.\\nStand beside me. I wish a clear view of them. My future bride will be among\\nthem.\"\\n\"Paul!\" Jessica snapped. \"Don\\'t make the mistake your father made!\"\\n\"She\\'s a princess,\" Paul said. \"She\\'s my key to the throne, and that\\'s all\\nshe\\'ll ever be. Mistake? You think because I\\'m what you made me that I cannot\\nfeel the need for revenge?\"\\n\"Even on the innocent?\" she asked, and she thought: He must not make the\\nmistakes I made.\\n\"There are no innocent any more,\" Paul said.\\n\"Tell that to Chani,\" Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from the\\nrear of the Residency.\\nChani entered the Great Hall there, walking between the Fremen guards as\\nthough unaware of them. Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back, face mask\\nfastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to\\nstand beside Jessica.\\nPaul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks -- She gives water to the dead. He\\nfelt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he could only feel\\nthis thing through Chani\\'s presence.\\n\"He is dead, beloved,\" Chani said. \"Our son is dead.\"\\nHolding himself under stiff control, Paul got to his feet. He reached out,\\ntouched Chani\\'s cheek, feeling the dampness of her tears. \"He cannot be\\nreplaced,\" Paul said, \"but there will be other sons. It is Usul who promises\\nthis.\" Gently, he moved her aside, gestured to Stilgar.\\n\"Muad\\'Dib,\" Stilgar said.\\n\"They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people,\" Paul said. \"I will\\nstand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in, the center of the room.\\nThey will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I command\\notherwise.\"\\n\"As you command, Muad\\'Dib.\"\\nAs Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen guards:\\n\"You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!\"\\nThe Emperor\\'s entourage could be heard approaching now, his Sardaukar\\nhumming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits. There came a\\nmurmur of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the guard,\\ncrossed to confer with Stilgar, then moved to Paul\\'s side, a strange look in His\\neyes.\\nWill I lose Gurney, too? Paul wondered. The way I lost Stilgar -- losing a\\nfriend to gain a creature?\\n\"They have no throwing weapons,\" Gurney said. \"I\\'ve made sure of that\\nmyself.\" He glanced around the room, seeing Paul\\'s preparations. \"Feyd-Rautha\\nHarkonnen is with them. Shall I cut him out?\"\\n\"Leave him.\"\\n\"There\\'re some Guild people, too, demanding special privileges, threatening\\nan embargo against Arrakis. I told them I\\'d give you their message.\"\\n\"Let them threaten.\"\\n\"Paul!\" Jessica hissed behind him. \"He\\'s talking about the Guild!\"\\n\"I\\'ll pull their fangs presently,\" Paul said.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd he thought then about the Guild -- the force that had specialized for so\\nlong that it had become a parasite, unable to exist independently of the life\\nupon which it fed. They had never dared grasp the sword . . . and now they could\\nnot grasp it. They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of\\nspecializing on the melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators.\\nThey could have done this, lived their glorious day and died. Instead, they\\'d\\nexisted from moment to moment, hoping the seas in which they swam might produce\\na new host when the old one died.\\nThe Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal\\ndecision: they\\'d chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward\\ninto stagnation.\\nLet them look closely at their new host, Paul thought.\\n\"There\\'s also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she\\'s a friend of\\nyour mother,\" Gurney said.\\n\"My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends.\"\\nAgain, Gurney glanced around the Great Hall, then bent close to Paul\\'s ear.\\n\"Thufir Hawat\\'s with \\'em, m\\'Lord. I had no chance to see him alone, but he used\\nour old hand signs to say he\\'s been working with the Harkonnens, thought you\\nwere dead. Says he\\'s to be left among \\'em.\"\\n\"You left Thufir among those --\"\\n\"He wanted it . . . and I thought it best. If . . . there\\'s something wrong,\\nhe\\'s where we can control him. If not -- we\\'ve an ear on the other side.\"\\nPaul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this\\nmoment -- and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the\\nEmperor commanded he use against \"this upstart Duke.\"\\nThe entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short corridor of lances. There\\ncame a murmurous swish of garments, feet rasping the sand that had drifted into\\nthe Residency.\\nThe Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His burseg\\nhelmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His uniform\\'s left\\nsleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without\\nweapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that kept\\nhis immediate area open.\\nA Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had ordered.\\nThe others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and of staring\\nfaces.\\nPaul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of weeping,\\nsaw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a Sardaukar victory\\nand now stood choked to silence by defeat. Paul saw the bird-bright eyes of the\\nReverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring beneath her black hood, and beside\\nher the narrow furtiveness of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.\\nThere\\'s a face time betrayed to me, Paul thought.\\nHe looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by a movement, seeing there a\\nnarrow, weaselish face he\\'d never before encountered -- not in time or out of\\nit. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a\\nmarker of fear.\\nWhy should I fear that man? he wondered.\\nHe leaned toward his mother, whispered: \"That man to the left of the\\nReverend Mother, the evil-looking one -- who is that?\"\\nJessica looked, recognizing the face from her Duke\\'s dossiers. \"Count\\nFenring,\" she said. \"The one who was here immediately before us. A genetic eunuch . . . and a killer.\"\\nThe Emperor\\'s errand boy, Paul thought. And the thought was a shock crashing\\nacross his consciousness because he had seen the Emperor in uncounted\\nassociations spread through the possible futures--but never once had Count\\nFenring appeared within those prescient visions.\\n\\n\\x0cIt occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless\\nreaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment of death.\\nHave I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me?\\nPaul wondered.\\nThe thought sent a pang of foreboding through him. He forced his attention\\naway from Fenring, looked now at the remnants of Sardaukar men and officers, the\\nbitterness on their faces and the desperation. Here and there among them, faces\\ncaught Paul\\'s attention briefly: Sardaukar officers measuring the preparations\\nwithin this room, planning and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into\\nvictory.\\nPaul\\'s attention came at last to a tall blonde woman, green-eyed, a face of\\npatrician beauty, classic in its hauteur, untouched by tears, completely\\nundefeated. Without being told it, Paul knew her -- Princess Royal, Bene\\nGesserit -- trained, a face that time vision had shown him in many aspects:\\nIrulan.\\nThere\\'s my key, he thought.\\nThen he saw movement in the clustered people, a face and figure emerged -Thufir Hawat, the seamed old features with darkly stained lips, the hunched\\nshoulders, the look of fragile age about him.\\n\"There\\'s Thufir Hawat,\" Paul said. \"Let him stand free, Gurney.\"\\n\"M\\'Lord,\" Gurney said.\\n\"Let him stand free,\" Paul repeated.\\nGurney nodded.\\nHawat shambled forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him.\\nThe rheumy eyes peered at Paul, measuring, seeking.\\nPaul stepped forward one pace, sensed the tense, waiting movement of the\\nEmperor and his people.\\nHawat\\'s gaze stabbed past Paul, and the old man said: \"Lady Jessica, I but\\nlearned this day how I\\'ve wronged you in my thoughts. You needn\\'t forgive.\"\\nPaul waited, but his mother remained silent.\\n\"Thufir, old friend,\" Paul said, \"as you can see, my back is toward no\\ndoor.\"\\n\"The universe is full of doors,\" Hawat said.\\n\"Am I my father\\'s son?\" Paul asked.\\n\"More like your grandfather\\'s,\" Hawat rasped. \"You\\'ve his manner and the\\nlook of him in your eyes.\"\\n\"Yet I\\'m my father\\'s son,\" Paul said. \"For I say to you, Thufir, that in\\npayment for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything you wish\\nof me. Anything at all. Do you need my life now, Thufir? It is yours.\" Paul\\nstepped forward a pace, hands at his side, seeing the look of awareness grow in\\nHawat\\'s eyes.\\nHe realizes that I know of the treachery, Paul thought.\\nPitching his voice to carry in a half-whisper for Hawat\\'s ears alone, Paul\\nsaid: \"I mean this, Thufir. If you\\'re to strike me, do it now.\"\\n\"I but wanted to stand before you once more, my Duke,\" Hawat said. And Paul\\nbecame aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted to keep from\\nfalling. Paul reached out, supported Hawat by the shoulders, feeling the muscle\\ntremors beneath his hands.\\n\"Is there pain, old friend?\" Paul asked.\\n\"There is pain, my Duke,\" Hawat agreed, \"but the pleasure is greater.\" He\\nhalf turned in Paul\\'s arms, extended his left hand, palm up, toward the Emperor,\\nexposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers. \"See, Majesty?\" he called.\\n\"See your traitor\\'s needle? Did you think that I who\\'ve given my life to service\\nof the Atreides would give them less now?\"\\nPaul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms, felt the death there, the\\nutter flaccidity. Gently, Paul lowered Hawat to the floor, straightened and\\nsigned for guardsmen to carry the body away.\\n\\n\\x0cSilence held the hall while his command was obeyed.\\nA look of deadly waiting held the Emperor\\'s face now. Eyes that had never\\nadmitted fear admitted it at last.\\n\"Majesty,\" Paul said, and noted the jerk of surprised attention in the tall\\nPrincess Royal. The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit controlled\\natonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that Paul could put\\nthere.\\nBene-Gesserit trained indeed, Paul thought.\\nThe Emperor cleared his throat, said: \"Perhaps my respected kinsman believes\\nhe has things all his own way now. Nothing could be more remote from fact. You\\nhave violated the Convention, used atomics against --\"\\n\"I used atomics against a natural feature of the desert,\" Paul said. \"It was\\nin my way and I was in a hurry to get to you, Majesty, to ask your explanation\\nfor some of your strange activities.\"\\n\"There\\'s a massed armada of the Great Houses in space over Arrakis right\\nnow,\" the Emperor said. \"I\\'ve but to say the word and they\\'ll --\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" Paul said, \"I almost forgot about them.\" He searched through the\\nEmperor\\'s suite until he saw the faces of the two Guildsmen, spoke aside to\\nGurney. \"Are those the Guild agents, Gurney, the two fat ones dressed in gray\\nover there?\"\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"\\n\"You two,\" Paul said, pointing. \"Get out of there immediately and dispatch\\nmessages that will get that fleet on its way home. After this, you\\'ll ask my\\npermission before --\"\\n\"The Guild doesn\\'t take your orders!\" the taller of the two barked. He and\\nhis companion pushed through to the barrier lances, which were raised at a nod\\nfrom Paul. The two men stepped out and the taller leveled an arm at Paul, said:\\n\"You may very well be under embargo for your --\"\\n\"If I hear any more nonsense from either of you,\" Paul said, \"I\\'ll give the\\norder that\\'ll destroy all spice production on Arrakis . . . forever.\"\\n\"Are you mad?\" the tall Guildsman demanded. He fell back half a step.\\n\"You grant that I have the power to do this thing, then?\" Paul asked.\\nThe Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment, then: \"Yes, you could\\ndo it, but you must not.\"\\n\"Ah-h-h,\" Paul said and nodded to himself. \"Guild navigators, both of you,\\neh?\"\\n\"Yes!\"\\nThe shorter of the pair said: \"You would blind yourself, too, and condemn us\\nall to slow death. Have you any idea what it means to be deprived of the spice\\nliquor once you\\'re addicted?\"\\n\"The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever,\" Paul said.\\n\"The Guild is crippled. Humans become little isolated clusters on their isolated\\nplanets. You know, I might do this thing out of pure spite . . . or out of\\nennui.\"\\n\"Let us talk this over privately,\" the taller Guildsman said. \"I\\'m sure we\\ncan come to some compromise that is --\"\\n\"Send the message to your people over Arrakis,\" Paul said. \"I grow tired of\\nthis argument. If that fleet over us doesn\\'t leave soon there\\'ll be no need for\\nus to talk.\" He nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall.\\n\"You may use our equipment.\"\\n\"First we must discuss this,\" the tall Guildsman said. \"We cannot just --\"\\n\"Do it!\" Paul barked. \"The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control\\nover it. You\\'ve agreed I have that power. We are not here to discuss or to\\nnegotiate or to compromise. You will obey my orders or suffer the immediate\\nconsequences!\"\\n\"He means it,\" the shorter Guildsman said. And Paul saw the fear grip them.\\nSlowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Will they obey?\" Gurney asked.\\n\"They have a narrow vision of time,\" Paul said. \"They can see ahead to a\\nblank wall marking the consequences of disobedience. Every Guild navigator on\\nevery ship over us can look ahead to that same wall. They\\'ll obey.\"\\nPaul turned back to look at the Emperor, said: \"When they permitted you to\\nmount your father\\'s throne, it was only on the assurance that you\\'d keep the\\nspice flowing. You\\'ve failed them, Majesty. Do you know the consequences?\"\\n\"Nobody permitted me to --\"\\n\"Stop playing the fool,\" Paul barked. \"The Guild is like a village beside a\\nriver. They need the water, but can only dip out what they require. They cannot\\ndam the river and control it, because that focuses attention on what they take,\\nit brings down eventual destruction. The spice flow, that\\'s their river, and I\\nhave built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without\\ndestroying the river.\"\\nThe Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the\\ntwo Guildsmen.\\n\"Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling,\" Paul said. \"There are\\nother poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once they\\'ve\\nused the spice liquor, the others no longer work.\"\\nThe old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward\\nout of the crowd to stand at the barrier lances.\\n\"Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,\" Paul said. \"It has been a long time\\nsince Caladan, hasn\\'t it?\"\\nShe looked past him at his mother, said: \"Well, Jessica, I see that your son\\nis indeed the one. For that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your\\ndaughter.\"\\nPaul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: \"You\\'ve never had the right or\\ncause to forgive my mother anything!\"\\nThe old woman locked eyes with him.\\n\"Try your tricks on me, old witch,\" Paul said. \"Where\\'s your gom jabbar? Try\\nlooking into that place where you dare not look! You\\'ll find me there staring\\nout at you!\"\\nThe old woman dropped her gaze.\\n\"Have you nothing to say?\" Paul demanded.\\n\"I welcomed you to the ranks of humans,\" she muttered. \"Don\\'t besmirch\\nthat.\"\\nPaul raised his voice: \"Observe her, comrades! This is a Bene Gesserit\\nReverend Mother, patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters -ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to\\nproduce the one person their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that\\nthe ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand . . . but . . . I\\n. . . will . . . never . . . do . . . her . . . bidding!\"\\n\"Jessica!\" the old woman screamed. \"Silence him!\"\\n\"Silence him yourself,\" Jessica said.\\nPaul glared at the old woman. \"For your part in all this I could gladly have\\nyou strangled,\" he said. \"You couldn\\'t prevent it!\" he snapped as she stiffened\\nin rage. \"But I think it better punishment that you live out your years never\\nable to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires.\"\\n\"Jessica, what have you done?\" the old woman demanded.\\n\"I\\'ll give you only one thing,\" Paul said. \"You saw part of what the race\\nneeds, but how poorly you saw it. You think to control human breeding and\\nintermix a select few according to your master plan! How little you understand\\nof what --\"\\n\"You mustn\\'t speak of these things!\" the old woman hissed.\\n\"Silence!\" Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted\\nthrough the air between them under Paul\\'s control.\\n\\n\\x0cThe old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her, face blank with\\nshock at the power with which he had seized her psyche. \"Jessica, \"she\\nwhispered. \"Jessica.\"\\n\"I remember your gom jabbar,\" Paul said. \"You remember mine. I can kill you\\nwith a word.\"\\nThe Fremen around the ball glanced knowingly at each other. Did the legend\\nnot say: \"And his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against\\nrighteousness.\"\\nPaul turned his attention to the tall Princess Royal standing beside her\\nEmperor father. Keeping his eyes focused on her, he said: \"Majesty, we both know\\nthe way out of our difficulty.\"\\nThe Emperor glanced at his daughter, back to Paul. \"You dare? You! An\\nadventurer without family, a nobody from --\"\\n\"You\\'ve already admitted who I am,\" Paul said. \"Royal kinsman, you said.\\nLet\\'s stop this nonsense.\"\\n\"I am your ruler,\" the Emperor said.\\nPaul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment\\nand facing him. One of them nodded.\\n\"I could force it,\" Paul said.\\n\"You will not dare!\" the Emperor grated.\\nPaul merely stared at him.\\nThe Princess Royal put a hand on her father\\'s arm. \"Father,\" she said, and\\nher voice was silky soft, soothing.\\n\"Don\\'t try your tricks on me,\" the Emperor said. He looked at her. \"You\\ndon\\'t need to do this, Daughter. We\\'ve other resources that --\"\\n\"But here\\'s a man fit to be your son,\" she said.\\nThe old Reverend Mother, her composure regained, forced her way to the\\nEmperor\\'s side, leaned close to his ear and whispered.\\n\"She pleads your case,\" Jessica said.\\nPaul continued to look at the golden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother,\\nhe said: \"That\\'s Irulan, the oldest, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nChani moved up on Paul\\'s other side, said: \"Do you wish me to leave,\\nMuad\\'Dib?\"\\nHe glanced at her. \"Leave? You\\'ll never again leave my side.\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing binding between us,\" Chani said.\\nPaul looked down at her for a silent moment, then: \"Speak only truth with\\nme, my Sihaya.\" As she started to reply, he silenced her with a finger to her\\nlips. \"That which binds us cannot be loosed,\" he said. \"Now, watch these matters\\nclosely for I wish to see this room later through your wisdom.\"\\nThe Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a heated, low-voiced\\nargument.\\nPaul spoke to his mother: \"She reminds him that it\\'s part of their agreement\\nto place a Bene Gesserit on the throne, and Irulan is the one they\\'ve groomed\\nfor it.\"\\n\"Was that their plan?\" Jessica said.\\n\"Isn\\'t it obvious?\" Paul asked.\\n\"I see the signs!\" Jessica snapped. \"My question was meant to remind you\\nthat you should not try to teach me those matters in which I instructed you.\"\\nPaul glanced at her, caught a cold smile on her lips.\\nGurney Halleck leaned between them, said: \"I remind you, m\\'Lord, that\\nthere\\'s a Harkonnen in that bunch.\" He nodded toward the dark-haired Feyd-Rautha\\npressed against a barrier lance on the left. \"The one with the squinting eyes\\nthere on the left. As evil a face as I ever say. You promised me once that --\"\\n\"Thank you, Gurney,\" Paul said.\\n\"It\\'s the na-Baron . . . Baron now that the old man\\'s dead,\" Gurney said.\\n\"He\\'ll do for what I\\'ve in --\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Can you take him, Gurney?\" \"M\\'Lord jests!\"\\n\"That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough,\\ndon\\'t you think, Mother?\"\\nShe nodded. \"Indeed.\"\\nPaul raised his voice, called out to the Emperor: \"Majesty, is there a\\nHarkonnen among you?\"\\nRoyal disdain revealed itself in the way the Emperor turned to look at Paul.\\n\"I believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal\\nword,\" he said.\\n\"My question was for information only,\" Paul said. \"I wish to know if a\\nHarkonnen is officially a part of your entourage or if a Harkonnen is merely\\nhiding behind a technicality out of cowardice.\"\\nThe Emperor\\'s smile was calculating. \"Anyone accepted into the Imperial\\ncompany is a member of my entourage.\"\\n\"You have the word of a Duke,\" Paul said, \"but Muad\\'Dib is another matter.\\nHe may not recognize your definition of what constitutes an entourage. My friend\\nGurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen. If he --\"\\n\"Kanly!\" Feyd-Rautha shouted. He pressed against the barrier lance. \"Your\\nfather named this vendetta, Atreides. You call me coward while you hide among\\nyour women and offer to send a lackey against me!\"\\nThe old Truthsayer whispered something fiercely into the Emperor\\'s ear, but\\nhe pushed her aside, said: \"Kanly, is it? There are strict rules for kanly.\"\\n\"Paul, put a stop to this,\" Jessica said.\\n\"M\\'Lord,\" Gurney said, \"You promised me my day against the Harkonnens.\"\\n\"You\\'ve had your day against them,\" Paul said and he felt a harlequin\\nabandon take over his emotions. He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders,\\nhanded them to his mother with his belt and crysknife, began unstrapping his\\nstillsuit. He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment.\\n\"There\\'s no need for this,\" Jessica said. \"There are easier ways, Paul.\"\\nPaul stepped out of his stillsuit, slipped the crysknife from its sheath in\\nhis mother\\'s hand. \"I know,\" he said. \"Poison, an assassin, all the old familiar\\nways.\"\\n\"You promised me a Harkonnen!\" Gurney hissed, and Paul marked the rage in\\nthe man\\'s face, the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridged. \"You owe it\\nto me, m\\'Lord!\"\\n\"Have you suffered more from them than I?\" Paul asked.\\n\"My sister,\" Gurney rasped. \"My years in the slave pits --\"\\n\"My father,\" Paul said. \"My good friends and companions, Thufir Hawat and\\nDuncan Idaho, my years as a fugitive without rank or succor . . . and one more\\nthing: it is now kanly and you know as well as I the rules that must prevail.\"\\nHalleck\\'s shoulders sagged. \"M\\'Lord, if that swine . . . he\\'s no more than a\\nbeast you\\'d spurn with your foot and discard the shoe because it\\'d been\\ncontaminated. Call in an executioner, if you must, or let me do it, but don\\'t\\noffer yourself to --\"\\n\"Muad\\'Dib need not do this thing,\" Chani said.\\nHe glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes. \"But the Duke Paul\\nmust,\" he said.\\n\"This is a Harkonnen animal!\" Gurney rasped.\\nPaul hesitated on the point of revealing his own Harkonnen ancestry, stopped\\nat a sharp look from his mother, said merely: \"But this being has human shape,\\nGurney, and deserves human doubt.\"\\nGurney said: \"If he so much as --\"\\n\"Please stand aside,\" Paul said. He hefted the crysknife, pushed Gurney\\ngently aside.\\n\"Gurney!\" Jessica said. She touched Gurney\\'s arm. \"He\\'s like his grandfather\\nin this mood. Don\\'t distract him. It\\'s the only thing you can do for him now.\"\\nAnd she thought: Great Mother! What irony.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha, seeing the heavy shoulders, the thick\\nmuscles. He turned to look at Paul -- a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as\\ndesiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in\\nthe flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the\\nskin.\\nJessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: \"One\\nthing, Son. Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit, a\\nword implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods. The\\nword-sound most frequently used is Uroshnor. If this one\\'s been prepared, as I\\nstrongly suspect, that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid\\nand --\"\\n\"I want no special advantage for this one,\" Paul said. \"Step back out of my\\nway.\"\\nGurney spoke to her: \"Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself\\nkilled and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds\\nhis reason?\"\\nJessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why\\nPaul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the\\nchanged Paul was capable of such a thing as Gurney suggested. Every talent\\nwithin her focused on the need to protect her son, but there was nothing she\\ncould do.\\n\"Is it this religious prattle?\" Gurney insisted.\\n\"Be silent,\" Jessica whispered. \"And pray.\"\\nThe Emperor\\'s face was touched by an abrupt smile. \"If Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen\\n. . . of my entourage . . . so wishes,\" he said, \"I relieve him of all restraint\\nand give him freedom to choose his own course in this.\" The Emperor waved a hand\\ntoward Paul\\'s Fedaykin guards. \"One of your rabble has my belt and short blade.\\nIf Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may meet you with my blade in his hand.\"\\n\"I wish it,\" Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man\\'s face.\\nHe\\'s overconfident, Paul thought. There\\'s a natural advantage I can accept.\\n\"Get the Emperor\\'s blade,\" Paul said, and watched as his command was obeyed.\\n\"Put it on the floor there.\" He indicated a place with his foot. \"Clear the\\nImperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear.\"\\nA flurry of robes, scraping of feet, low-voiced commands and protests\\naccompanied obedience to Paul\\'s command. The Guildsmen remained standing near\\nthe communications equipment. They frowned at Paul in obvious indecision.\\nThey\\'re accustomed to seeing the future, Paul thought. In this place and\\ntime they\\'re blind . . . even as I am. And he sampled the time-winds, sensing\\nthe turmoil, the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place. Even the\\nfaint gaps were closed now. Here was the unborn jihad, he knew. Here was the\\nrace consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose. Here was\\nreason enough for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Lisan al-Gaib or even the halting\\nschemes of the Bene Gesserit. The race of humans had felt its own dormancy,\\nsensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in\\nwhich the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans\\nwere alive as an unconscious single organism in this moment, experiencing a kind\\nof sexual heat that could override any barrier.\\nAnd Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit\\nof this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the jihad would\\nbe. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him. They needed only\\nthe legend he already had become. He had shown them the way, given them mastery\\neven over the Guild which must have the spice to exist.\\nA sense of failure pervaded him, and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha\\nHarkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform, stripped down to a fighting\\ngirdle with a mail core.\\nThis is the climax, Paul thought. From here, the future will open, the\\nclouds part onto a kind of glory. And if I die here, they\\'ll say I sacrificed\\n\\n\\x0cmyself that my spirit might lead them. And if I live, they\\'ll say nothing can\\noppose Muad\\'Dib.\\n\"Is the Atreides ready?\" Feyd-Rautha called, using the words of the ancient\\nkanly ritual.\\nPaul chose to answer him in the Fremen way: \"May thy knife chip and\\nshatter!\" He pointed to the Emperor\\'s blade on the floor, indicating that Feyd-Rautha should advance and take it.\\nKeeping his attention on Paul, Feyd-Rautha picked up the knife, balancing it\\na moment in his hand to get the feel of it. Excitement kindled in him. This was\\na fight he had dreamed about -- man against man, skill against skill with no\\nshields intervening. He could see a way to power opening before him because the\\nEmperor surely would reward whoever killed this troublesome duke. The reward\\nmight even be that haughty daughter and a share of the throne. And this yokel\\nduke, this back-world adventurer could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen\\ntrained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats. And the\\nyokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here.\\nLet us see if you\\'re proof against poison! Feyd-Rautha thought. He saluted\\nPaul with the Emperor\\'s blade, said: \"Meet your death, fool.\"\\n\"Shall we fight, cousin?\" Paul asked. And he cat-footed forward, eyes on the\\nwaiting blade, his body crouched low with his own milk-white crysknife pointing\\nout as though an extension of his arm.\\nThey circled each other, bare feet grating on the floor, watching with eyes\\nintent for the slightest opening.\\n\"How beautifully you dance,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\\nHe\\'s a talker, Paul thought. There\\'s another weakness. He grows uneasy in\\nthe face of silence.\\n\"Have you been shriven?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\nStill, Paul circled in silence.\\nAnd the old Reverend Mother, watching the fight from the press of the\\nEmperor\\'s suite, felt herself trembling. The Atreides youth had called the\\nHarkonnen cousin. It could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared, easy to\\nunderstand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words forced her to\\nfocus on the only thing that mattered to her here.\\nThis could be a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme.\\nShe had seen something of what Paul had seen here, that Feyd-Rautha might\\nkill but not be victorious. Another thought, though, almost overwhelmed her. Two\\nend products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the\\ndeath that might easily claim both of them. If both died here that would leave\\nonly Feyd-Rautha\\'s bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured\\nfactor, and Alia, the abomination.\\n\"Perhaps you have only pagan rites here,\" Feyd-Rautha said. \"Would you like\\nthe Emperor\\'s Truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey?\"\\nPaul smiled, circling to the right, alert, his black thoughts suppressed by\\nthe needs of the moment.\\nFeyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in\\na blur to his left hand.\\nPaul dodged easily, noting the shield-conditioned hesitation in Feyd-Rautha\\'s thrust. Still, it was not as great a shield conditioning as some Paul\\nhad seen, and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded\\nfoes.\\n\"Does an Atreides run or stand and fight?\" Feyd-Rautha asked.\\nPaul resumed his silent circling. Idaho\\'s words came back to him, the words\\nof training from the long-ago practice floor on Caladan: \"Use the first moments\\nin study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the\\nmoments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.\"\\n\"Perhaps you think this dance prolongs your life a few moments,\" Feyd-Rautha\\nsaid. \"Well and good.\" He stopped the circling, straightened.\\n\\n\\x0cPaul had seen enough for a first approximation. Feyd-Rautha led to the left\\nside, presenting the right hip as though the mailed fighting girdle could\\nprotect his entire side. It was the action of a man trained to the shield and\\nwith a knife in both hands.\\nOr . . . And Paul hesitated . . . the girdle was more than it seemed.\\nThe Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who\\'d this day led the\\nforces of victory against Sardaukar legions.\\nFeyd-Rautha noted the hesitation, said: \"Why prolong the inevitable? You but\\nkeep me from exercising my rights over this ball of dirt.\"\\nIf it\\'s a flip-dart, Paul thought, it\\'s a cunning one. The girdle shows no\\nsigns of tampering.\\n\"Why don\\'t you speak?\" Feyd-Rautha demanded.\\nPaul resumed his probing circle, allowing himself a cold smile at the tone\\nof unease in Feyd-Rautha\\'s voice, evidence that the pressure of silence was\\nbuilding.\\n\"You smile, eh?\" Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in mid-sentence.\\nExpecting the slight hesitation, Paul almost failed to evade the downflash\\nof blade, felt its tip scratch his left arm. He silenced the sudden pain there,\\nhis mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick - an over-feint. Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There would\\nbe tricks within tricks within tricks.\\n\"Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my skills,\" Feyd-Rautha said. \"He\\ngave me first blood. Too bad the old fool didn\\'t live to see it.\"\\nAnd Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, \"Expect only what happens in the\\nfight. That way you\\'ll never be surprised.\"\\nAgain the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.\\nPaul saw the return of elation to his opponent, wondered at it. Did a\\nscratch signify that much to the man? Unless there were poison on the blade! But\\nhow could there be? His own men had handled the weapon, snooped it before\\npassing it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that.\\n\"That woman you were talking to over there,\" Feyd-Rautha said. \"The little\\none. Is she something special to you? A pet perhaps? Will she deserve my special\\nattentions?\"\\nPaul remained silent, probing with his inner senses, examining the blood\\nfrom the wound, finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor\\'s blade. He\\nrealigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the molecules of\\nthe soporific, but he felt a thrill of doubt. They\\'d been prepared with\\nsoporific on a blade. A soporific. Nothing to alert a poison snooper, but strong\\nenough to slow the muscles it touched. His enemies had their own plans within\\nplans, their own stacked treacheries.\\nAgain Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.\\nPaul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with slowness as though\\ninhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing\\narm on the crysknife\\'s point.\\nFeyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to his\\nleft hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed\\nthe acid pain where Paul had cut him.\\nLet him know his own moment of doubt, Paul thought. Let him suspect poison.\\n\"Treachery!\" Feyd-Rautha shouted. \"He\\'s poisoned me! I do feel poison in my\\narm!\"\\nPaul dropped his cloak of silence, said: \"Only a little acid to counter the\\nsoporific on the Emperor\\'s blade.\"\\nFeyd-Rautha matched Paul\\'s cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock\\nsalute. His eyes glared rage behind the knife.\\nPaul shifted his crysknife to his left hand, matching his opponent. Again,\\nthey circled, probing.\\n\\n\\x0cFeyd-Rautha began closing the space between them, edging in, knife held\\nhigh, anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw. He feinted right and\\nunder, and they were pressed against each other, knife hands gripped, straining.\\nPaul, cautious of Feyd-Rautha\\'s right hip where he suspected a poison flip-dart, forced the turn to the right. He almost failed to see the needlepoint\\nflick out beneath the belt line. A shift and a giving in Feyd-Rautha\\'s motion\\nwarned him. The tiny point missed Paul\\'s flesh by the barest fraction.\\nOn the left hip!\\nTreachery within treachery within treachery, Paul reminded himself. Using\\nBene Gesserit-trained muscles, he sagged to catch a reflex in Feyd-Rautha, but\\nthe necessity of avoiding the tiny point jutting from his opponent\\'s hip threw\\nPaul off just enough that he missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to\\nthe floor, Feyd-Rautha on top.\\n\"You see it there on my hip?\" Feyd-Rautha whispered. \"Your death, fool.\" And\\nhe began twisting himself around, forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer.\\n\"It\\'ll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you. There\\'ll be never a trace\\nleft to detect!\"\\nPaul strained, hearing the silent screams in his mind, his cell-stamped\\nancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to save\\nhimself.\\n\"I will not say it!\" Paul gasped.\\nFeyd-Rautha gaped at him, caught in the merest fraction of hesitation. It\\nwas enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponent\\'s leg\\nmuscles, and their positions were reversed. Feyd-Rautha lay partly underneath\\nwith right hip high, unable to turn because of the tiny needlepoint caught\\nagainst the floor beneath him.\\nPaul twisted his left hand free, aided by the lubrication of blood from his\\narm, thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha\\'s jaw. The point slid home into\\nthe brain. Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back, still held partly on his side by\\nthe needle imbedded in the floor.\\nBreathing deeply to restore his calm, Paul pushed himself away and got to\\nhis feet. He stood over the body, knife in hand, raised his eyes with deliberate\\nslowness to look across the room at the Emperor.\\n\"Majesty,\" Paul said, \"your force is reduced by one more. Shall we now shed\\nsham and pretense? Shall we now discuss what must be? Your daughter wed to me\\nand the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne.\"\\nThe Emperor turned, looked at Count Fenring. The Count met his stare -- gray\\neyes against green. The thought lay there clearly between them, their\\nassociation so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance.\\nKill this upstart for me, the Emperor was saying. The Atreides is young and\\nresourceful, yes -- but he is also tired from long effort and he\\'d be no match\\nfor you, anyway. Call him out now . . . you know the way of it. Kill him.\\nSlowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.\\n\"Do it!\" the Emperor hissed.\\nThe Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in\\nthe Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this\\nAtreides youth.\\nI could kill him, Fenring thought -- and he knew this for a truth.\\nSomething in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he glimpsed\\nbriefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul -- a way of hiding from\\nthe youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate.\\nPaul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled, understood\\nat last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of prescience. Fenring was\\none of the might-have-beens, an almost Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in\\nthe genetic pattern -- a eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and\\ninner seclusion. A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul, the first\\nsense of brotherhood he\\'d ever experienced.\\n\\n\\x0cFenring, reading Paul\\'s emotion, said, \"Majesty, I must refuse.\"\\nRage overcame Shaddam IV. He took two short steps through the entourage,\\ncuffed Fenring viciously across the jaw.\\nA dark flush spread up and over the Count\\'s face. He looked directly at the\\nEmperor, spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis: \"We have been friends, Majesty.\\nWhat I do now is out of friendship. I shall forget that you struck me.\"\\nPaul cleared his throat, said: \"We were speaking of the throne, Majesty.\"\\nThe Emperor whirled, glared at Paul. \"I sit on the throne!\" he barked.\\n\"You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus,\" Paul said.\\n\"I put down my arms and came here on your word of bond!\" the Emperor\\nshouted. \"You dare threaten --\"\\n\"Your person is safe in my presence,\" Paul said. \"An Atreides promised it.\\nMuad\\'Dib, however, sentences you to your prison planet. But have no fear,\\nMajesty. I will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my\\ndisposal. It shall become a garden world, full of gentle things.\"\\nAs the hidden import of Paul\\'s words grew in the Emperor\\'s mind, he glared\\nacross the room at Paul. \"Now we see true motives,\" he sneered.\\n\"Indeed,\" Paul said.\\n\"And what of Arrakis?\" the Emperor asked. \"Another garden world full of\\ngentle things?\"\\n\"The Fremen have the word of Muad\\'Dib,\" Paul said. \"There will be flowing\\nwater here open to the sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have\\nthe spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis . . .\\nand fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: \\'God\\ncreated Arrakis to train the faithful.\\' One cannot go against the word of God.\"\\nThe old Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her own view\\nof the hidden meaning in Paul\\'s words now. She glimpsed the jihad and said: \"You\\ncannot loose these people upon the universe!\"\\n\"You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar!\" Paul snapped.\\n\"You cannot,\" she whispered.\\n\"You\\'re a Truthsayer,\" Paul said. \"Review your words.\" He glanced at the\\nPrincess Royal, back to the Emperor. \"Best be done quickly, Majesty.\"\\nThe Emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter. She touched his arm,\\nspoke soothingly: \"For this I was trained, Father.\"\\nHe took a deep breath.\\n\"You cannot stay this thing,\" the old Truthsayer muttered.\\nThe Emperor straightened, standing stiffly with a look of remembered\\ndignity. \"Who will negotiate for you, kinsman?\" he asked.\\nPaul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy-lidded, standing with Chani in a\\nsquad of Fedaykin guards. He crossed to them, stood looking down at Chani.\\n\"I know the reasons,\" Chani whispered. \"If it must be . . . Usul.\"\\nPaul, hearing the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. \"My Sihaya\\nneed fear nothing, ever,\" he whispered. He dropped his arm, faced his mother.\\n\"You will negotiate for me. Mother, with Chani by your side. She has wisdom and\\nsharp eyes. And it is wisely said that no one bargains tougher than a Fremen.\\nShe will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of\\nher sons to be, what they will need. Listen to her.\"\\nJessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son, put down a shudder. \"What\\nare your instructions?\" she asked.\\n\"The Emperor\\'s entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry,\" he said.\\n\"Entire?\" She was shocked almost speechless.\\n\"He is to be stripped. I\\'ll want an earldom and CHOAM directorship for\\nGurney Halleck, and him in the fief of Caladan. There will be titles and\\nattendant power for every surviving Atreides man, not excepting the lowliest\\ntrooper.\"\\n\"What of the Fremen?\" Jessica asked.\\n\\n\\x0c\"The Fremen are mine,\" Paul said. \"What they receive shall be dispensed by\\nMuad\\'Dib. It\\'ll begin with Stilgar as Governor on Arrakis, but that can wait.\"\\n\"And for me?\" Jessica asked.\\n\"Is there something you wish?\"\\n\"Perhaps Caladan,\" she said, looking at Gurney. \"I\\'m not certain. I\\'ve\\nbecome too much the Fremen . . . and the Reverend Mother. I need a time of peace\\nand stillness in which to think.\"\\n\"That you shall have,\" Paul said, \"and anything else that Gurney or I can\\ngive you.\"\\nJessica nodded, feeling suddenly old and tired. She looked at Chani. \"And\\nfor the royal concubine?\"\\n\"No title for me,\" Chani whispered. \"Nothing. I beg of you.\"\\nPaul stared down into her eyes, remembering her suddenly as she had stood\\nonce with little Leto in her arms, their child now dead in this violence. \"I\\nswear to you now,\" he whispered, \"that you\\'ll need no title. That woman over\\nthere will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing\\nand we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the\\nLandsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me\\nthan my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of\\ndesire.\"\\n\"So you say now,\" Chani said. She glanced across the room at the tail\\nprincess.\\n\"Do you know so little of my son?\" Jessica whispered. \"See that princess\\nstanding there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a\\nliterary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she\\'ll have little\\nelse.\" A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. \"Think on it, Chani: that princess will\\nhave the name, yet she\\'ll live as less than a concubine -- never to know a\\nmoment of tenderness from the man to whom she\\'s bound. While we, Chani, we who\\ncarry the name of concubine -- history will call us wives.\"\\n', 51: '\\nAppendix I: The Ecology of Dune\\nBeyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers\\nincrease. This is as true of humans in the finite space of a planetary ecosystem\\nas it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how many\\ncan possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible\\nfor those who do survive.\\n-Pardot Kynes, First Planetologist of Arrakis\\nThe effect of Arrakis on the mind of the newcomer usually is that of\\noverpowering barren land. The stranger might think nothing could live or grow in\\nthe open here, that this was the true wasteland that had never been fertile and\\nnever would be.\\nTo Pardot Kynes, the planet was merely an expression of energy, a machine\\nbeing driven by its sun. What it needed was reshaping to fit it to man\\'s needs.\\nHis mind went directly to the free-moving human population, the Fremen. What a\\nchallenge! What a tool they could be! Fremen: an ecological and geological force\\nof almost unlimited potential.\\nA direct and simple man in many ways, Pardot Kynes. One must evade Harkonnen\\nrestrictions? Excellent. Then one marries a Fremen woman. When she gives you a\\nFremen son, you begin with him, with Liet-Kynes, and the other children,\\nteaching them ecological literacy, creating a new language with symbols that arm\\nthe mind to manipulate an entire landscape, its climate, seasonal limits, and\\nfinally to break through all ideas of force into the dazzling awareness of\\norder.\\n\\n\\x0c\"There\\'s an internally recognized beauty of motion and balance on any man healthy planet,\" Kynes said. \"You see in this beauty a dynamic stabilizing\\neffect essential to all life. Its aim is simple; to maintain and produce\\ncoordinated patterns of greater and greater diversity. Life improves the closed\\nsystem\\'s capacity to sustain life. Life -- all life -- is in the service of\\nlife. Necessary nutrients are made available to life by life in greater and\\ngreater richness as the diversity of life increases. The entire landscape comes\\nalive, filled with relationships and relationships within relationships.\"\\nThis was Pardot Kynes lecturing to a sietch warren class.\\nBefore the lectures, though, he had to convince the Fremen. To understand\\nhow this came about, you must first understand the enormous single-mindedness,\\nthe innocence with which he approached any problem. He was not naive, he merely\\npermitted himself no distractions.\\nHe was exploring the Arrakis landscape in a one-man groundcar one hot\\nafternoon when he stumbled onto a deplorably common scene. Six Harkonnen bravos,\\nshielded and fully armed, had trapped three Fremen youths in the open behind the\\nShield Wall near the village of Windsack. To Kynes, it was a ding-dong battle,\\nmore slapstick then real, until he focused on the fact that the Harkonnens\\nintended to kill the Fremen. By this time, one of the youths was down with a\\nsevered artery, two of the bravos were down as well, but it was still four armed\\nmen against two striplings.\\nKynes wasn\\'t brave; he merely had that single-mindedness and caution. The\\nHarkonnens were killing Fremen. They were destroying the tools with which he\\nintended to remake a planet! He triggered his own shield, waded in and had two\\nof the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip before they knew anyone was behind them.\\nHe dodged a sword thrust from one of the others, slit the man\\'s throat with a\\nneat entrisseur, and left the lone remaining bravo to the two Fremen youths,\\nturning his full attention to saving the lad on the ground. And save the lad he\\ndid . . . while the sixth Harkonnen was being dispatched.\\nNow here was a pretty kettle of sandtrout! The Fremen didn\\'t know what to\\nmake of Kynes. They knew who he was, of course. No man arrived on Arrakis\\nwithout a full dossier finding its way into the Fremen strongholds. They knew\\nhim: he was an Imperial servant.\\nBut he killed Harkonnens!\\nAdults might have shrugged and, with some regret, sent his shade to join\\nthose of the six dead men on the ground. But these Fremen were inexperienced\\nyouths and all they could see was that they owed this Imperial servant a mortal\\nobligation.\\nKynes wound up two days later in a sietch that looked down on Wind Pass. To\\nhim, it was all very natural. He talked to the Fremen about water, about dunes\\nanchored by grass, about palmaries filled with date palms, about open qanats\\nflowing across the desert. He talked and talked and talked.\\nAll around him raged a debate that Kynes never saw. What to do with this\\nmadman? He knew the location of a major sietch. What to do? What of his words,\\nthis mad talk about a paradise on Arrakis? Just talk. He knows too much. But he\\nkilled Harkonnens! What of the water burden? When did we owe the Imperium\\nanything? He killed Harkonnens. Anyone can kill Harkonnens. I have done it\\nmyself.\\nBut what of this talk about the flowering of Arrakis?\\nVery simple: Where is the water for this?\\nHe says it is here! And he did save three of ours.\\nHe saved three fools who had put themselves in the way of the Harkonnen\\nfist! And he has seen crysknives!\\nThe necessary decision was known for hours before it was voiced. The tau of\\na sietch tells its members what they must do; even the most brutal necessity is\\nknown. An experienced fighter was sent with a consecrated knife to do the job.\\nTwo watermen followed him to get the water from the body. Brutal necessity.\\n\\n\\x0cIt\\'s doubtful that Kynes even focused on his would-be executioner. He was\\ntalking to a group that spread around him at a cautious distance. He walked as\\nhe talked: a short circle, gesturing. Open water, Kynes said. Walk in the open\\nwithout stillsuits. Water for dipping it out of a pond! Portyguls!\\nThe knifeman confronted him.\\n\"Remove yourself,\" Kynes said, and went on talking about secret windtraps.\\nHe brushed past the man. Kynes\\' back stood open for the ceremonial blow.\\nWhat went on in that would-be executioner\\'s mind cannot be known now. Did he\\nfinally listen to Kynes and believe? Who knows? But what he did is a matter of\\nrecord. Uliet was his name, Older Liet. Uliet walked three paces and\\ndeliberately fell on his own knife, thus \"removing\" himself. Suicide? Some say\\nShai-hulud moved him.\\nTalk about omens!\\nFrom that instant, Kynes had but to point, saying \"Go there.\" Entire Fremen\\ntribes went. Men died, women died, children died. But they went.\\nKynes returned to his Imperial chores, directing the Biological Testing\\nStations. And now, Fremen began to appear among the Station personnel. The\\nFremen looked at each other. They were infiltrating the \"system,\" a possibility\\nthey\\'d never considered. Station tools began finding their way into the sietch\\nwarrens -- especially cutterays which were used to dig underground catchbasins\\nand hidden windtraps.\\nWater began collecting in the basins.\\nIt became apparent to the Fremen that Kynes was not a madman totally, just\\nmad enough to be holy. He was one of the umma, the brotherhood of prophets. The\\nshade of Uliet was advanced to the sadus, the throne of heavenly judges.\\nKynes -- direct, savagely intent Kynes -- knew that highly organized\\nresearch is guaranteed to produce nothing new. He set up small-unit experiments\\nwith regular interchange of data for a swift Tansley effect, let each group find\\nits own path. They must accumulate millions of tiny facts. He organized only\\nisolated and rough run-through tests to put their difficulties into perspective.\\nCore samplings were made throughout the bled. Charts were developed on the\\nlong drifts of weather that are called climate. He found that in the wide belt\\ncontained by the 70-degree lines, north and south, temperatures for thousands of\\nyears hadn\\'t gone outside the 254-332 degrees (absolute) range, and that this\\nbelt had long growing seasons where temperatures ranged, from 284 to 302 degrees\\nabsolute: the \"bonanza\" range for terraform life . . . once they solved the\\nwater problem.\\nWhen will we solve it? the Fremen asked. When will we see Arrakis as a\\nparadise?\\nIn the manner of a teacher answering a child who has asked the sum of 2 plus\\n2, Kynes told them: \"From three hundred to five hundred years.\"\\nA lesser folk might have howled in dismay. But the Fremen had learned\\npatience from men with whips. It was a bit longer than they had anticipated, but\\nthey all could see that the blessed day was coming. They tightened their sashes\\nand went back to work. Somehow, the disappointment made the prospect of paradise\\nmore real.\\nThe concern on Arrakis was not with water, but with moisture. Pets were\\nalmost unknown, stock animals rare. Some smugglers employed the domesticated\\ndesert ass, the kulon, but the water price was high even when the beasts were\\nfitted with modified stillsuits.\\nKynes thought of installing reduction plants to recover water from the\\nhydrogen and oxygen locked in native rock, but the energy-cost factor was far\\ntoo high. The polar caps (disregarding the false sense of water security they\\ngave the pyons) held far too small an amount for his project . . . and he\\nalready suspected where the water had to be. There was that consistent increase\\nof moisture at median altitudes, and in certain winds. There was that primary\\n\\n\\x0cclue in the air balance -- 23 per cent oxygen, 75.4 per cent nitrogen and .023\\nper cent carbon dioxide -- with the trace gases taking up the rest.\\nThere was a rare native root plant that grew above the 2,500 meter level in\\nthe northern temperate zone. A tuber two meters long yielded half a liter of\\nwater. And there were the terraform desert plants: the tougher ones showed signs\\nof thriving if planted in depressions lined with dew precipitators.\\nThen Kynes saw the salt pan.\\nHis \\'thopter, flying between stations far out on the bled, was blown off\\ncourse by a storm. When the storm passed, there was the pan -- a giant oval\\ndepression some three hundred kilometers on the long axis -- a glaring white\\nsurprise in the open desert. Kynes landed, tasted the pan\\'s storm-cleaned\\nsurface.\\nSalt.\\nNow, he was certain.\\nThere\\'d been open water on Arrakis -- once. He began reexamining the\\nevidence of the dry wells where trickles of water had appeared and vanished,\\nnever to return.\\nKynes set his newly trained Fremen limnologists to work: their chief clue,\\nleathery scraps of matter sometimes found with the spice-mass after a blow. This\\nhad been ascribed to a fictional \"sandtrout\" in Fremen folk stories. As facts\\ngrew into evidence, a creature emerged to explain these leathery scraps -- a\\nsandswimmer that blocked off water into fertile pockets within the porous lower\\nstrata below the 280° (absolute) line.\\nThis \"water-stealer\" died by the millions in each spice-blow. A five-degree\\nchange in temperature could kill it. The few survivors entered a semidormant\\ncyst-hibernation to emerge in six years as small (about three meters long)\\nsandworms. Of these, only a few avoided their larger brothers and pre-spice\\nwater pockets to emerge into maturity as the giant shai-hulud. (Water is\\npoisonous to shai-hulud as the Fremen had long known from drowning the rare\\n\"stunted worm\" of the Minor Erg to produce the awareness-spectrum narcotic they\\ncall Water of Life. The \"stunted worm\" is a primitive form of shai-hulud that\\nreaches a length of only about nine meters.)\\nNow they had the circular relationship: little maker to pre-spice mass;\\nlittle maker to shai-hulud; shai-hulud to scatter the spice upon which fed\\nmicroscopic creatures called sand plankton; the sand plankton, food for shaihulud, growing, burrowing, becoming little makers.\\nKynes and his people turned their attention from these great relationships\\nand focused now on micro-ecology. First, the climate: the sand surface often\\nreached temperatures of 344° to 350° (absolute). A foot below ground it might be\\n55° cooler; a foot above ground, 25° cooler. Leaves or black shade could provide\\nanother 18° of cooling. Next, the nutrients: sand of Arrakis is mostly a product\\nof worm digestion; dust (the truly omnipresent problem there) is produced by the\\nconstant surface creep, the \"saltation\" movement of sand. Coarse grains are\\nfound on the downwind sides of dunes. The windward side is packed smooth and\\nhard. Old dunes are yellow (oxidized), young dunes are the color of the parent\\nrock -- usually gray.\\nDownwind sides of old dunes provided the first plantation areas. The Fremen\\naimed first for a cycle of poverty grass with peatlike hair cilia to intertwine,\\nmat and fix the dunes by depriving the wind of its big weapon: movable grains.\\nAdaptive zones were laid out in the deep south far from Harkonnen watchers.\\nThe mutated poverty grasses were planted first along the downwind (slipface) of\\nthe chosen dunes that stood across the path of the prevailing westerlies. With\\nthe downwind face anchored, the windward face grew higher and higher and the\\ngrass was moved to keep pace. Giant sifs (long dunes with sinuous crest) of more\\nthan 1,500 meters height were produced this way.\\n\\n\\x0cWhen barrier dunes reached sufficient height, the windward faces were\\nplanted with tougher sword grasses. Each structure on a base about six times as\\nthick as its height was anchored -- \"fixed.\"\\nNow, they came in with deeper plantings -- ephemerals (chenopods, pigweeds,\\nand amaranth to begin), then scotch broom, low lupine, vine eucalyptus (the type\\nadapted for Caladan\\'s northern reaches), dwarf tamarisk, shore pine -- then the\\ntrue desert growths: candelilla, saguaro, and bis-naga, the barrel cactus. Where\\nit would grow, they introduced camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild\\nalfalfa, burrow bush, sand verbena, evening primrose, incense bush, smoke tree,\\ncreosote bush.\\nThey turned then to the necessary animal life -- burrowing creatures to open\\nthe soil and aerate it: kit fox, kangaroo mouse, desert hare, sand terrapin . .\\n. and the predators to keep them in check: desert hawk, dwarf owl, eagle and\\ndesert owl; and insects to fill the niches these couldn\\'t reach: scorpion,\\ncentipede, trapdoor spider, the biting wasp and the wormfly . . . and the desert\\nbat to keep watch on these.\\nNow came the crucial test: date palms, cotton, melons, coffee, medicinals -more than 200 selected food plant types to test and adapt.\\n\"The thing the ecologically illiterate don\\'t realize about an ecosystem,\"\\nKynes said, \"is that it\\'s a system. A system! A system maintains a certain fluid\\nstability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has\\norder, a flowing from point to point. If something dams that flow, order\\ncollapses. The untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late. That\\'s\\nwhy the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences.\"\\nHad they achieved a system?\\nKynes and his people watched and waited. The Fremen now knew what he meant\\nby an open-end prediction to five hundred years.\\nA report came up from the palmaries:\\nAt the desert edge of the plantings, the sand plankton is being poisoned\\nthrough interaction with the new forms of life. The reason: protein\\nincompatibility. Poisonous water was forming there which the Arrakis life would\\nnot touch. A barren zone surrounded the plantings and even shai-hulud would not\\ninvade it.\\nKynes went down to the palmaries himself -- a twenty-thumper trip (in a\\npalanquin like a wounded man or Reverend Mother because he never became a\\nsandrider). He tested the barren zone (it stank to heaven) and came up with a\\nbonus, a gift from Arrakis.\\nThe addition of sulfur and fixed nitrogen converted the barren zone to a\\nrich plant bed for terraform life. The plantings could be advanced at will!\\n\"Does this change the timing?\" the Fremen asked.\\nKynes went back to his planetary formulae. Windtrap figures were fairly\\nsecure by then. He was generous with his allowances, knowing he couldn\\'t draw\\nneat lines around ecological problems. A certain amount of plant cover had to be\\nset aside to hold dunes in place; a certain amount for foodstuffs (both human\\nand animal); a certain amount to lock moisture in root systems and to feed water\\nout into surrounding parched areas. They\\'d mapped the roving cold spots on the\\nopen bled by this time. These had to be figured into the formulae. Even shaihulud had a place in the charts. He must never be destroyed, else spice wealth\\nwould end. But his inner digestive \"factory,\" with its enormous concentrations\\nof aldehydes and acids, was a giant source of oxygen. A medium worm (about 200\\nmeters long) discharged into the atmosphere as much oxygen as ten square\\nkilometers of green growing photosynthesis surface.\\nHe had the Guild to consider. The spice bribe to the Guild for preventing\\nweather satellites and other watchers in the skies of Arrakis already had\\nreached major proportions.\\nNor could the Fremen be ignored. Especially the Fremen, with their windtraps\\nand irregular landholdings organized around water supply; the Fremen with their\\n\\n\\x0cnew ecological literacy and their dream of cycling vast areas of Arrakis through\\na prairie phase into forest cover.\\nFrom the charts emerged a figure. Kynes reported it. Three per cent. If they\\ncould get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in\\nforming carbon compounds, they\\'d have their self-sustaining cycle.\\n\"But how long?\" the Fremen demanded.\\n\"Oh, that: about three hundred and fifty years.\"\\nSo it was true as this umma had said in the beginning: the thing would not\\ncome in the lifetime of any man now living, nor in the lifetime of their\\ngrandchildren eight times removed, but it would come.\\nThe work continued: building, planting, digging, training the children.\\nThen Kynes-the-Umma was killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.\\nBy this time his son, Liet-Kynes, was nineteen, a full Fremen and sandrider\\nwho had killed more than a hundred Harkonnens. The Imperial appointment for\\nwhich the elder Kynes already had applied in the name of his son was delivered\\nas a matter of course. The rigid class structure of the faufreluches had its\\nwell-ordered purpose here. The son had been trained to follow the father.\\nThe course had been set by this time, the Ecological-Fremen were aimed along\\ntheir way. Liet-Kynes had only to watch and nudge and spy upon the Harkonnens .\\n. . until the day his planet was afflicted by a Hero.\\n', 52: '\\nAppendix II: The Religion of Dune\\nBefore the coming of Muad\\'Dib, the Fremen of Arrakis practiced a religion\\nwhose roots in the Maometh Saari are there for any scholar to see. Many have\\ntraced the extensive borrowings from other religions. The most common example is\\nthe Hymn to Water, a direct copy from the Orange Catholic Liturgical Manual,\\ncalling for rain clouds which Arrakis had never seen. But there are more\\nprofound points of accord between the Kitab al-Ibar of the Fremen and the\\nteachings of Bible, Ilm, and Fiqh.\\nAny comparison of the religious beliefs dominant in the Imperium up to the\\ntime of Muad\\'Dib must start with the major forces which shaped those beliefs:\\n1. The followers of the Fourteen Sages, whose Book was the Orange Catholic\\nBible, and whose views are expressed in the Commentaries and other literature\\nproduced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators. (C.E.T.);\\n2. The Bene Gesserit, who privately denied they were a religious order, but\\nwho operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual mysticism, and whose\\ntraining, whose symbolism, organization, and internal teaching methods were\\nalmost wholly religious;\\n3. The agnostic ruling class (including the Guild) for whom religion was a\\nkind of puppet show to amuse the populace and keep it docile, and who believed\\nessentially that all phenomena -- even religious phenomena -- could be reduced\\nto mechanical explanations;\\n4. The so-called Ancient Teachings -- including those preserved by the\\nZensunni Wanderers from the first, second, and third Islamic movements; the\\nNavachristianity of Chusuk, the Buddislamic Variants of the types dominant at\\nLankiveil and Sikun, the Blend Books of the Mahayana Lankavatara, the Zen\\nHekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and Talmudic Zabur surviving on\\nSalusa Secundus, the pervasive Obeah Ritual, the Muadh Quran with its pure Ilm\\nand Fiqh preserved among the pundi rice farmers of Caladan, the Hindu\\noutcroppings found all through the universe in little pockets of insulated\\npyons, and finally, the Butlerian Jihad.\\nThere is a fifth force which shaped religious belief, but its effect is so\\nuniversal and profound that it deserves to stand alone.\\n\\n\\x0cThis is, of course, space travel -- and in any discussion of religion, it\\ndeserves to be written thus:\\nSPACE TRAVEL!\\nMankind\\'s movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion\\nduring the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the Butlerian Jihad. To\\nbegin with, early space travel, although widespread, was largely unregulated,\\nslow, and uncertain, and, before the Guild monopoly, was accomplished by a\\nhodgepodge of methods. The first space experiences, poorly communicated and\\nsubject to extreme distortion, were a wild inducement to mystical speculation.\\nImmediately, space gave a different flavor and sense to ideas of Creation.\\nThat difference is seen even in the highest religious achievements of the\\nperiod. All through religion, the feeling of the sacred was touched by anarchy\\nfrom the outer dark.\\nIt was as though Jupiter in all his descendant forms retreated into the\\nmaternal darkness to be superseded by a female immanence filled with ambiguity\\nand with a face of many terrors.\\nThe ancient formulae intertwined, tangled together as they were fitted to\\nthe needs of new conquests and new heraldic symbols. It was a time of struggle\\nbetween beast-demons on the one side and the old prayers and invocations on the\\nother.\\nThere was never a clear decision.\\nDuring this period, it was said that Genesis was reinterpreted, permitting\\nGod to say:\\n\"Increase and multiply, and fill the universe, and subdue it, and rule over\\nall manner of strange beasts and living creatures in the infinite airs, on the\\ninfinite earths and beneath them.\"\\nIt was a time of sorceresses whose powers were real. The measure of them is\\nseen in the fact they never boasted how they grasped the firebrand.\\nThen came the Butlerian Jihad -- two generations of chaos. The god of\\nmachine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was raised:\\n\"Man may not be replaced.\"\\nThose two generations of violence were a thalamic pause for all humankind.\\nMen looked at their gods and their rituals and saw that both were filled with\\nthat most terrible of all equations: fear over ambition.\\nHesitantly, the leaders of religions whose followers had spilled the blood\\nof billions began meeting to exchange views. It was a move encouraged by the\\nSpacing Guild, which was beginning to build its monopoly over all interstellar\\ntravel, and by the Bene Gesserit who were banding the sorceresses.\\nOut of those first ecumenical meetings came two major developments:\\n1. The realization that all religions had at least one common commandment:\\n\"Thou shall not disfigure the soul.\"\\n2. The Commission of Ecumenical Translators.\\nC.E.T. convened on a neutral island of Old Earth, spawning ground of the\\nmother religions. They met \"in the common belief that there exists a Divine\\nEssence in the universe.\" Every faith with more than a million followers was\\nrepresented, and they reached a surprisingly immediate agreement on the\\nstatement of their common goal:\\n\"We are here to remove a primary weapon from the hands of disputant\\nreligions. That weapon -- the claim to possession of the one and only\\nrevelation.\"\\nJubilation at this \"sign of profound accord\" proved premature. For more than\\na standard year, that statement was the only announcement from C.E.T. Men spoke\\nbitterly of the delay. Troubadours composed witty, biting songs about the one\\nhundred and twenty-one \"Old Cranks\" as the C.E.T. delegates came to be called.\\n(The name arose from a ribald joke which played on the C.E.T. initials and\\n\\n\\x0ccalled the delegates \"Cranks-Effing-Turners.\") One of the songs, \"Brown Repose,\"\\nhas undergone periodic revival and is popular even today:\\n\"Consider leis.\\nBrown repose -- and\\nThe tragedy\\nIn all of those\\nCranks! All those Cranks!\\nSo laze -- so laze\\nThrough all your days.\\nTime has toll\\'d for\\nM\\'Lord Sandwich!\"\\nOccasional rumors leaked out of the C.E.T. sessions. It was said they were\\ncomparing texts and, irresponsibly, the texts were named. Such rumors inevitably\\nprovoked anti-ecumenism riots and, of course, inspired new witticisms.\\nTwo years passed . . . three years.\\nThe Commissioners, nine of their original number having died and been\\nreplaced, paused to observe formal installation of the replacements and\\nannounced they were laboring to produce one book, weeding out \"all the\\npathological symptoms\" of the religious past.\\n\"We are producing an instrument of Love to be played in all ways,\" they\\nsaid.\\nMany consider it odd that this statement provoked the worst outbreaks of\\nviolence against ecumenism. Twenty delegates were recalled by their\\ncongregations. One committed suicide by stealing a space frigate and diving it\\ninto the sun.\\nHistorians estimate the riots took eighty million lives. That works out to\\nabout six thousand for each world then in the Landsraad League. Considering the\\nunrest of the time, this may not be an excessive estimate, although any pretense\\nto real accuracy in the figure must be just that -- pretense. Communication\\nbetween worlds was at one of its lowest ebbs.\\nThe troubadours, quite naturally, had a field day. A popular musical comedy\\nof the period had one of the C.E.T. delegates sitting on a white sand beach\\nbeneath a palm tree singing:\\n\"For God, woman and the splendor of love\\nWe dally here sans fears or cares.\\nTroubadour! Troubadour, sing another melody\\nFor God, Woman and the splendor of love!\"\\nRiots and comedy are but symptoms of the times, profoundly revealing. They\\nbetray the psychological tone, the deep uncertainties . . . and the striving for\\nsomething better, plus the fear that nothing would come of it all.\\nThe major dams against anarchy in these times were the embryo Guild, the\\nBene Gesserit and the Landsraad, which continued its 2,000-year record of\\nmeeting in spite of the severest obstacles. The Guild\\'s part appears clear: they\\ngave free transport for all Landsraad and C.E.T. business. The Bene Gesserit\\nrole is more obscure. Certainly, this is the time in which they consolidated\\ntheir hold upon the sorceresses, explored the subtle narcotics, developed pranabindu training and conceived the Missionaria Protectiva, that black arm of\\nsuperstition. But it is also the period that saw the composing of the Litany\\nagainst Fear and the assembly of the Azhar Book, that bibliographic marvel that\\npreserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths.\\nIngsley\\'s comment is perhaps the only one possible:\\n\"Those were times of deep paradox.\"\\n\\n\\x0cFor almost seven years, then, C.E.T. labored. And as their seventh\\nanniversary approached, they prepared the human universe for a momentous\\nannouncement. On that seventh anniversary, they unveiled the Orange Catholic\\nBible.\\n\"Here is a work with dignity and meaning,\" they said. \"Here is a way to make\\nhumanity aware of itself as a total creation of God.\"\\nThe men of C.E.T. were likened to archeologists of ideas, inspired by God in\\nthe grandeur of rediscovery. It was said they had brought to light \"the vitality\\nof great ideals overlaid by the deposits of centuries,\" that they had \"sharpened\\nthe moral imperatives that come out of a religious conscience.\"\\nWith the O.C. Bible, C.E.T. presented the Liturgical Manual and the\\nCommentaries -- in many respects a more remarkable work, not only because of its\\nbrevity (less than half the size of the O.C. Bible), but also because of its\\ncandor and blend of self-pity and self-righteousness.\\nThe beginning is an obvious appeal to the agnostic rulers.\\n\"Men, finding no answers to the sunnan [the ten thousand religious questions\\nfrom the Shari-ah] now apply their own reasoning. All men seek to be\\nenlightened. Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men\\nhave striven to make sense out of God\\'s universe. Scientists seek the lawfulness\\nof events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.\"\\nIn their conclusion, though, the Commentaries set a harsh tone that very\\nlikely foretold their fate.\\n\"Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of\\nhostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys\\npleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must\\nsee that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The\\nproper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it\\nawakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you\\'ve\\nalways known.\"\\nThere was an odd sense of calm as the presses and shigawire imprinters\\nrolled and the O.C. Bible spread out through the worlds. Some interpreted this\\nas a sign from God, an omen of unity.\\nBut even the C.E.T. delegates betrayed the fiction of that calm as they\\nreturned to their respective congregations. Eighteen of them were lynched within\\ntwo months. Fifty-three recanted within the year.\\nThe O.C. Bible was denounced as a work produced by \"the hubris of reason.\"\\nIt was said that its pages were filled with a seductive interest in logic.\\nRevisions that catered to popular bigotry began appearing. These revisions\\nleaned on accepted symbolisms (Cross, Crescent, Feather Rattle, the Twelve\\nSaints, the thin Buddha, and the like) and it soon became apparent that the\\nancient superstitions and beliefs had not been absorbed by the new ecumenism.\\nHalloway\\'s label for C.E.T.\\'s seven-year effort -- \"Galactophasic\\nDeterminism\" -- was snapped up by eager billions who interpreted the initials\\nG.D. as \"God-Damned.\"\\nC.E.T. Chairman Toure Bomoko, an Ulema of the Zensunnis and one of the\\nfourteen delegates who never recanted (\"The Fourteen Sages\" of popular history),\\nappeared to admit finally the C.E.T. had erred.\\n\"We shouldn\\'t have tried to create new symbols,\" he said. \"We should\\'ve\\nrealized we weren\\'t supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted belief,\\nthat we weren\\'t supposed to stir up curiosity about God. We are daily confronted\\nby the terrifying instability of all things human, yet we permit our religions\\nto grow more rigid and controlled, more conforming and oppressive. What is this\\nshadow across the highway of Divine Command? It is a warning that institutions\\nendure, that symbols endure when their meaning is lost, that there is no summa\\nof all attainable knowledge.\"\\nThe bitter double edge in this \"admission\" did not escape Bomoko\\'s critics\\nand he was forced soon afterward to flee into exile, his life dependent upon the\\n\\n\\x0cGuild\\'s pledge of secrecy. He reportedly died on Tupile, honored and beloved,\\nhis last words: \"Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to\\nthemselves, \\'I am not the kind of person I want to be.\\' It must never sink into\\nan assemblage of the self-satisfied.\"\\nIt is pleasant to think that Bomoko understood the prophecy in his words:\\n\"Institutions endure.\" Ninety generations later, the O.C. Bible and the\\nCommentaries permeated the religious universe.\\nWhen Paul-Muad\\'Dib stood with his right hand on the rock shrine enclosing\\nhis father\\'s skull (the right hand of the blessed, not the left hand of the\\ndamned) he quoted word for word from \"Bomoko\\'s Legacy\" -\"You who have defeated us say to yourselves that Babylon is fallen and its\\nworks have been overturned. I say to you still that man remains on trial, each\\nman in his own dock. Each man is a little war.\"\\nThe Fremen said of Muad\\'Dib that he was like Abu Zide whose frigate defied\\nthe Guild and rode one day \\'there\\' and back. \\'There\\' used in this way translates\\ndirectly from the Fremen mythology as the land of the ruh-spirit, the alam almithal where all limitations are removed.\\nThe parallel between this and the Kwisatz Haderach is readily seen. The\\nKwisatz Haderach that the Sisterhood sought through its breeding program was\\ninterpreted as \"The shortening of the way\" or \"The one who can be two places\\nsimultaneously.\"\\nBut both of these interpretations can be shown to stem directly from the\\nCommentaries: \"When law and religious duty are one, your selfdom encloses the\\nuniverse.\"\\nOf himself, Muad\\'Dib said: \"I am a net in the sea of time, free to sweep\\nfuture and past. I am a moving membrane from whom no possibility can escape.\"\\nThese thoughts are all one and the same and they harken to 22 Kalima in the\\nO.C. Bible where it says: \"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing\\nand has powers of reality.\"\\nIt is when we get into Muad\\'Dib\\'s own commentaries in \"The Pillars of the\\nUniverse\" as interpreted by his holy men, the Qizara Tafwid, that we see his\\nreal debt to C.E.T. and Fremen-Zensunni.\\nMuad\\'Dib: \"Law and duty are one; so be it. But remember these limitations -Thus are you never fully self-conscious. Thus do you remain immersed in the\\ncommunal tau. Thus are you always less than an individual.\"\\nO.C. Bible: Identical wording. (61 Revelations.)\\nMuad\\'Dib: \"Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us\\nfrom the terrors of an uncertain future.\"\\nC.E.T. Commentaries: Identical wording. (The Azhar Book traces this\\nstatement to the first century religious writer, Neshou; through a paraphrase.)\\nMuad\\'Dib: \"If a child, an untrained person, an ignorant person, or an insane\\nperson incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not predicting and\\npreventing that trouble. \"\\nO.C. Bible: \"Any sin can be ascribed, at least in part, to a natural bad\\ntendency that is an extenuating circumstance acceptable to God.\" (The Azhar Book\\ntraces this to the ancient Semitic Tawra.)\\nMuad\\'Dib: \"Reach forth thy hand and eat what God has provided thee; and when\\nthou are replenished, praise the Lord.\"\\nO.C. Bible: a paraphrase with identical meaning. (The Azhar Book traces this\\nin slightly different form to First Islam.)\\nMuad\\'Dib: \"Kindness is the beginning of cruelty.\"\\nFremen Kitab al-Ibar: \"The weight of a kindly God is a fearful thing. Did\\nnot God give us the burning sun (Al-Lat)? Did not God give us the Mothers of\\nMoisture (Reverend Mothers)? Did not God give us Shaitan (Iblis, Satan)? From\\nShaitan did we not get the hurtfulness of speed?\"\\n\\n\\x0c(This is the source of the Fremen saying: \"Speed comes from Shaitan.\"\\nConsider: for every one hundred calories of heat generated by exercise [speed]\\nthe body evaporates about six ounces of perspiration. The Fremen word for\\nperspiration is bakka or tears and, in one pronunciation, translates: \"The life\\nessence that Shaitan squeezes from your soul.\")\\nMuad\\'Dib\\'s arrival is called \"religiously timely\" by Koneywell, but timing\\nhad little to do with it. As Muad\\'Dib himself said: \"I am here; so . . . \"\\nIt is, however, vital to an understanding of Muad\\'Dib\\'s religious impact\\nthat you never lose sight of one fact: the Fremen were a desert people whose\\nentire ancestry was accustomed to hostile landscapes. Mysticism isn\\'t difficult\\nwhen you survive each second by surmounting open hostility. \"You are there -- so\\n. . . \"\\nWith such a tradition, suffering is accepted -- perhaps as unconscious\\npunishment, but accepted. And it\\'s well to note that Fremen ritual gives almost\\ncomplete freedom from guilt feelings. This isn\\'t necessarily because their law\\nand religion were identical, making disobedience a sin. It\\'s likely closer to\\nthe mark to say they cleansed themselves of guilt easily because their everyday\\nexistence required brutal judgments (often deadly) which in a softer land would\\nburden men with unbearable guilt.\\nThis is likely one of the roots of Fremen emphasis on superstition\\n(disregarding the Missionaria Protectiva\\'s ministrations). What matter that\\nwhistling sands are an omen? What matter that you must make the sign of the fist\\nwhen first you see First Moon? A man\\'s flesh is his own and his water belongs to\\nthe tribe -- and the mystery of life isn\\'t a problem to solve but a reality to\\nexperience. Omens help you remember this. And because you are here, because you\\nhave the religion, victory cannot evade you in the end.\\nAs the Bene Gesserit taught for centuries, long before they ran afoul of the\\nFremen:\\n\"When religion and politics ride the same cart, when that cart is driven by\\na living holy man (baraka), nothing can stand in their path.\"\\n', 53: '\\nAppendix III: Report on Bene Gesserit Motives and Purposes\\nHere follows an excerpt from the Summa prepared by her own agents at the request\\nof the Lady Jessica immediately after the Arrakis Affair. The candor of this\\nreport amplifies its value far beyond the ordinary.\\nBecause the Bene Gesserit operated for centuries behind the blind of a semimystic school while carrying on their selective breeding program among humans,\\nwe tend to award them with more status than they appear to deserve. Analysis of\\ntheir \"trial of fact\" on the Arrakis Affair betrays the school\\'s profound\\nignorance of its own role.\\nIt may be argued that the Bene Gesserit could examine only such facts as\\nwere available to them and had no direct access to the person of the Prophet\\nMuad\\'Dib. But the school had surmounted greater obstacles and its error here\\ngoes deeper.\\nThe Bene Gesserit program had as its target the breeding of a person they\\nlabeled \"Kwisatz Haderach,\" a term signifying \"one who can be many places at\\nonce.\" In simpler terms, what they sought was a human with mental powers\\npermitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions.\\nThey were breeding for a super-Mentat, a human computer with some of the\\nprescient abilities found in Guild navigators. Now, attend these facts\\ncarefully:\\n\\n\\x0cMuad\\'Dib, born Paul Atreides, was the son of the Duke Leto, a man whose\\nbloodline had been watched carefully for more than a thousand years. The\\nProphet\\'s mother, Lady Jessica, was a natural daughter of the Baron Vladimir\\nHarkonnen and carried gene-markers whose supreme importance to the breeding\\nprogram was known for almost two thousand years. She was a Bene Gesserit bred\\nand trained, and should have been a willing tool of the project.\\nThe Lady Jessica was ordered to produce an Atreides daughter. The plan was\\nto inbreed this daughter with Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, a nephew of the Baron\\nVladimir, with the high probability of a Kwisatz Haderach from that union.\\nInstead, for reasons she confesses have never been completely clear to her, the\\nconcubine Lady Jessica defied her orders and bore a son.\\nThis alone should have alerted the Bene Gesserit to the possibility that a\\nwild variable had entered their scheme. But there were other far more important\\nindications that they virtually ignored:\\n1. As a youth, Paul Atreides showed ability to predict the future. He was\\nknown to have had prescient visions that were accurate, penetrating, and defied\\nfour-dimensional explanation.\\n2. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Proctor who tested\\nPaul\\'s humanity when he was fifteen, deposes that he surmounted more agony in\\nthe test than any other human of record. Yet she failed to make special note of\\nthis in her report!\\n3. When Family Atreides moved to the planet Arrakis, the Fremen population\\nthere hailed the young Paul as a prophet, \"the voice from the outer world.\" The\\nBene Gesserit were well aware that the rigors of such a planet as Arrakis with\\nits totality of desert landscape, its absolute lack of open water, its emphasis\\non the most primitive necessities for survival, inevitably produces a high\\nproportion of sensitives. Yet this Fremen reaction and the obvious element of\\nthe Arrakeen diet high in spice were glossed over by Bene Gesserit observers.\\n4. When the Harkonnens and the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah Emperor\\nreoccupied Arrakis, killing Paul\\'s father and most of the Atreides troops, Paul\\nand his mother disappeared. But almost immediately there were reports of a new\\nreligious leader among the Fremen, a man called Muad\\'Dib, who again was hailed\\nas \"the voice from the outer world.\" The reports stated clearly that he was\\naccompanied by a new Reverend Mother of the Sayyadina Rite \"who is the woman who\\nbore him.\" Records available to the Bene Gesserit stated in plain terms that the\\nFremen legends of the Prophet contained these words: \"He shall be born of a Bene\\nGesserit witch.\"\\n(It may be argued here that the Bene Gesserit sent their Missionaria\\nProtectiva onto Arrakis centuries earlier to implant something like this legend\\nas safeguard should any members of the school be trapped there and require\\nsanctuary, and that this legend of \"the voice from the outer world\" was properly\\nto be ignored because it appeared to be the standard Bene Gesserit ruse. But\\nthis would be true only if you granted that the Bene Gesserit were correct in\\nignoring the other clues about Paul-Muad\\'Dib.)\\n5. When the Arrakis Affair boiled up, the Spacing Guild made overtures to\\nthe Bene Gesserit. The Guild hinted that its navigators, who use the spice drug\\nof Arrakis to produce the limited prescience necessary for guiding spaceships\\nthrough the void, were \"bothered about the future\" or saw \"problems on the\\nhorizon.\" This could only mean they saw a nexus, a meeting place of countless\\ndelicate decisions, beyond which the path was hidden from the prescient eye.\\nThis was a clear indication that some agency was interfering with higher order\\ndimensions!\\n(A few of the Bene Gesserit had long been aware that the Guild could not\\ninterfere directly with the vital spice source because Guild navigators already\\nwere dealing in their own inept way with higher order dimensions, at least to\\nthe point where they recognized that the slightest misstep they made on Arrakis\\ncould be catastrophic. It was a known fact that Guild navigators could predict\\n\\n\\x0cno way to take control of the spice without producing just such a nexus. The\\nobvious conclusion was that someone of higher order powers was taking control of\\nthe spice source, yet the Bene Gesserit missed this point entirely!)\\nIn the face of these facts, one is led to the inescapable conclusion that\\nthe inefficient Bene Gesserit behavior in this affair was a product of an even\\nhigher plan of which they were completely unaware!\\n', 54: '\\nAppendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)\\nSHADDAM IV (10,134-10,202)\\nThe Padishah Emperor, 81st of his line (House Corrino) to occupy the Golden Lion\\nThrone, reigned from 10,156 (date his father, Elrood IX, succumbed to chaumurky)\\nuntil replaced by the 10,196 Regency set up in the name of his eldest daughter,\\nIrulan.

An \"awareness spectrum\"\\nnarcotic.\\nWATERTUBE: any tube within a stillsuit or stilltent that carries reclaimed water\\ninto a catchpocket or from the catchpocket to the wearer.\\nWAY, BENE GESSERIT: use of the minutiae of observation.\\nWEATHER SCANNER; a person trained in the special methods of predicting weather\\non Arrakis, including ability to pole the sand and read the wind patterns.\\nWEIRDING: idiomatic: that which partakes of the mystical or of witchcraft.\\n\\n\\x0cWINDTRAP: a device placed in the path of a prevailing wind and capable of\\nprecipitating moisture from the air caught within it, usually by a sharp and\\ndistinct drop in temperature within the trap.\\nYA HYA CHOUHADA: \"Long live the fighters!\" The Fedaykin battle cry. Ya (now) in\\nthis cry is augmented by the hya form (the ever-extended now). Chouhada\\n(fighters) carries this added meaning of fighters against injustice. There is a\\ndistinction in this word that specifies the fighters are not struggling for\\nanything, but are consecrated against a specific thing -- that alone.\\nYALI: a Fremen\\'s personal quarters within the sietch.\\nYA! YA! YAWM!: Fremen chanting cadence used in time of deep ritual significance.\\nYa carries the root meaning of \"Now pay attention!\" The yawm form is a modified\\nterm calling for urgent immediacy. The chant is usually translated as \"Now, hear\\nthis!\"\\nZENSUNNI: followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of\\nMaometh (the so-called \"Third Muhammed\") about 1381 B.G. The Zensunni religion\\nis noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to \"the ways\\nof the fathers.\" Most scholars name Ali Ben Ohashi as leader of the original\\nschism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male\\nspokesman for his second wife, Nisai.\\n\\n\\x0c\\n'}\n"

And the price we paid was the price men have\\nalways paid for achieving a paradise in this life--we went soft, we lost our\\nedge.\\n-from \\\"Muad'Dib: Conversations\\\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\\"So you're the great Gurney Halleck,\\\" the man said.\\nHalleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated\\nbehind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes\\nthat told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space\\nfrigate's master control center--communications and viewscreens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk\\nformed as a wall projection--part of the remaining curve.\\n\\\"I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek,\\\" the smuggler said.\\n\\\"Then you're the one I owe thanks for the help we've received,\\\" Halleck\\nsaid.\\n\\\"Ah-h-h, gratitude,\\\" the smuggler said. \\\"Sit down.\\\"\\nA ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck\\nsank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection\\nnow in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in\\nhis lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.\\n\\n\\fHalleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family\\nresemblance in the smuggler now--the father's heavy, over-hanging eyebrows and\\nrock planes of cheeks and nose.\\n\\\"Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens,\\\" Halleck\\nsaid.\\n\\\"By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people,\\\" Tuek said.\\nAnger overcame part of Halleck's fatigue. He straightened, said: \\\"Can you\\nname the traitor?\\\"\\n\\\"We are not sure.\\\"\\n\\\"Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.\\\"\\n\\\"Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch . . . perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen\\ncaptive.\\\"\\n\\\"I heard,\\\" Halleck took a deep breath. \\\"It appears we've a deal more killing\\nahead of us.\\\"\\n\\\"We will do nothing to attract attention to us,\\\" Tuek said.\\nHalleck stiffened. \\\"But--\\\"\\n\\\"You and those of your men we've saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,\\\"\\nTuek said. \\\"You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can\\nalways use good men. We'll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the\\nslightest open move against the Harkonnens.\\\"\\n\\\"But they killed your father, man!\\\"\\n\\\"Perhaps. And if so, I'll give you my father's answer to those who act\\nwithout thinking: 'A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath\\nis heavier than them both.' \\\"\\n\\\"You mean to do nothing about it, then?\\\" Halleck sneered.\\n\\\"You did not hear me say that. I merely say I will protect our contract with\\nthe Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other\\nways of destroying a foe.\\\"\\n\\\"Ah-h-h-h-h.\\\"\\n\\\"Ah, indeed. If you've a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But I warn\\nyou that you're probably too late . . .and we doubt she's the one you want, any\\nway.\\\"\\n\\\"Hawat made few mistakes.\\\"\\n\\\"He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.\\\"\\n\\\"You think he's the traitor?\\\"\\nTuek shrugged. \\\"This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the\\nHarkonnens believe it.\\\"\\n\\\"You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.\\\"\\n\\\"Hints and suggestions . . . rumors and hunches.\\\"\\n\\\"We are seventy-four men,\\\" Halleck said. \\\"If you seriously wish us to enlist\\nwith you, you must believe our Duke is dead.\\\"\\n\\\"His body has been seen.\\\"\\n\\\"And the boy, too--young Master Paul?\\\" Halleck tried to swallow, found a\\nlump in his throat.\\n\\\"According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert\\nstorm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found.\\\"\\n\\\"So the witch is dead then . . . all dead.\\\"\\nTuek nodded. \\\"And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat\\nof power here on Dune.\\\"\\n\\\"The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\nIt took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to\\novercome him. He spoke with panting breath: \\\"I've a score of my own against\\nRabban. I owe him for the lives of my family . . . \\\" He rubbed at the scar along\\nhis jaw. \\\" . . . and for this . . . \\\"\\n\\n\\f\\\"One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely,\\\" Tuek said. He\\nfrowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck's jaw, the sudden withdrawal\\nin the man's shed-lidded eyes.\\n\\\"I know . . . I know.\\\" Halleck took a deep breath.\\n\\\"You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us.\\nThere are many places to--\\\"\\n\\\"I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With\\nRabban here--I stay.\\\"\\n\\\"In your mood, I'm not sure we want you to stay.\\\"\\nHalleck stared at the smuggler. \\\"You doubt my word?\\\"\\n\\\"No-o-o . . . \\\"\\n\\\"You've saved me from the Harkonnens. I gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no\\ngreater reason. I'll stay on Arrakis--with you . . . or with the Fremen.\\\"\\n\\\"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power,\\\"\\nTuek said. \\\"You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to\\nbe too sharp and quick.\\\"\\nHalleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him.\\n\\\"Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?\\\" he\\nmurmured.\\n\\\"Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"Speed is a\\ndevice of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow--we've the diversions for it; three things\\nthere are that ease the heart--water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.\\\"\\nHalleck opened his eyes. \\\"I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen\\nflowing about my feet.\\\" He stared at Tuek. \\\"You think that day will come?\\\"\\n\\\"I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. I can\\nonly help you meet today.\\\"\\n\\\"Then I'll accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge\\nyour father and all the others who--\\\"\\n\\\"Listen to me, fighting man,\\\" Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk,\\nhis shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler's face was suddenly\\nlike weathered stone. \\\"My father's water--I'll buy that back myself, with my own\\nblade.\\\"\\nHalleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the smuggler reminded him of\\nDuke Leto: a leader of men, courageous, secure in his own position and his own\\ncourse. He was like the Duke . . . before Arrakis.\\n\\\"Do you wish my blade beside you?\\\" Halleck asked.\\nTuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.\\n\\\"Do you think of me as fighting man? \\\" Halleck pressed.\\n\\\"You're the only one of the Duke's lieutenants to escape,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"Your\\nenemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him . . . You defeated him the way\\nwe defeat Arrakis.\\\"\\n\\\"Eh?\\\"\\n\\\"We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"Arrakis is\\nour enemy.\\\"\\n\\\"One enemy at a time, is that it?\\\"\\n\\\"That's it.\\\"\\n\\\"Is that the way the Fremen make out?\\\"\\n\\\"Perhaps.\\\"\\n\\\"You said I might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the\\ndesert, in the open, is that why?\\\"\\n\\\"Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man's\\nland. But I wish to talk more about--\\\"\\n\\\"I'm told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,\\\"\\nHalleck said. \\\"But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and\\nthere if you know where to look.\\\"\\n\\\"Rumors!\\\" Tuek sneered. \\\"Do you wish to choose now between me and the\\nFremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock,\\n\\n\\four own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few\\nragged bands that we use as spice-hunters.\\\"\\n\\\"But they can kill Harkonnens.\\\"\\n\\\"And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down\\nlike animals--with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being\\nexterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens.\\\"\\n\\\"Was it Harkonnens they killed?\\\" Halleck asked.\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\n\\\"Haven't you heard that there may've been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?\\\"\\n\\\"More rumors.\\\"\\n\\\"But a pogrom--that isn't like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful.\\\"\\n\\\"I believe what I see with my own eyes,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"Make your choice,\\nfighting man. Me or the Fremen. I will promise you sanctuary and a chance to\\ndraw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the\\nlife of the hunted.\\\"\\nHalleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek's words, yet troubled\\nfor no reason he could explain.\\n\\\"Trust your own abilities,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"Whose decisions brought your force\\nthrough the battle? Yours. Decide.\\\"\\n\\\"It must be,\\\" Halleck said. \\\"The Duke and his son are dead?\\\"\\n\\\"The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, I incline to\\ntrust the Harkonnens.\\\" A grim smile touched Tuek's mouth. \\\"But it's about the\\nonly trust I give them.\\\"\\n\\\"Then it must be,\\\" Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and\\nthumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. \\\"I give you my sword.\\\"\\n\\\"Accepted.\\\"\\n\\\"Do you wish me to persuade my men?\\\"\\n\\\"You'd let them make their own decision?\\\"\\n\\\"They've followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn't what\\nthey thought it'd be. Here, they've lost everything except their lives. I'd\\nprefer they decided for themselves now.\\\"\\n\\\"Now is no time for you to falter,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"They've followed you this\\nfar.\\\"\\n\\\"You need them, is that it?\\\"\\n\\\"We can always use experienced fighting men . . . in these times more than\\never.\\\"\\n\\\"You've accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?\\\"\\n\\\"I think they'll follow you, Gurney Halleck.\\\"\\n\\\" 'Tis to be hoped.\\\"\\n\\\"Indeed.\\\"\\n\\\"I may make my own decision in this, then?\\\"\\n\\\"Your own decision.\\\"\\nHalleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his\\nreserve strength even that small effort required. \\\"For now, I'll see to their\\nquarters and well-being,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Consult my quartermaster,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"Drisq is his name. Tell him it's my\\nwish that you receive every courtesy. I'll join you myself presently. I've some\\noff-shipments of spice to see to first.\\\"\\n\\\"Fortune passes everywhere,\\\" Halleck said.\\n\\\"Everywhere,\\\" Tuek said. \\\"A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our\\nbusiness.\\\"\\nHalleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a\\nlockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the\\noffice.\\nHe found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been\\nled by Tuek's aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native\\nrock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The\\n\\n\\fceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of\\nthe rock and to permit internal air-convection currents. Weapons racks and\\nlockers lined the walls.\\nHalleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to\\nstand were standing--no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler\\nmedics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled\\nin one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.\\nThe Atreides training--\\\"We care for our own!\\\"--it held like a core of native\\nrock in them, Halleck noted.\\nOne of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck's nine-string\\nbaliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, said: \\\"Sir, the medics here\\nsay there's no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here--only\\noutpost medicine. Mattai can't last, they say, and he has a request of you.\\\"\\n\\\"What is it?\\\"\\nThe lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. \\\"Mattai wants a song to ease his\\ngoing, sir. He says you'll know the one . . . he's asked it of you often\\nenough.\\\" The lieutenant swallowed. \\\"It's the one called 'My Woman,' sir. If you-\\\"\\n\\\"I know.\\\" Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch\\non the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone\\nhad already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of\\nhis thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to\\nsmile casually.\\nSeveral of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters.\\nOne of the men began singing softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:\\n\\\"My woman stands at her window,\\nCurved lines 'gainst square glass.\\nUprais'd arms . . . bent . . . downfolded.\\n'Gainst sunset red and golded-Come to me . . .\\nCome to me, warm arms of my lass.\\nFor me . . .\\nFor me, the warm arms of my lass.\\\"\\nThe singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the\\nman on the litter.\\nHalleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are\\nseventy-three.\\n\",\n          \"\\n\\\"Control the coinage and the courts -- let the rabble have the rest.\\\" Thus the\\nPadishah Emperor advises you. And he tells you: \\\"If you want profits, you must\\nrule.\\\" There is truth in these words, but I ask myself: \\\"Who are the rabble and\\nwho are the ruled?\\\"\\n-Muad'Dib's Secret Message to the Landsraad from \\\"Arrakis Awakening\\\" by the\\nPrincess Irulan\\nA thought came unbidden to Jessica's mind: Paul will be undergoing his\\nsandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but\\nit's obvious.\\nAnd Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.\\nJessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the\\nnight's classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had\\nenjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place\\nhad thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand,\\nmulticolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The\\nroom was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that\\nshe had come to associate with a sense of security.\\nYet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place.\\nIt was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.\\nA faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber.\\nJessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay's. Her time was near.\\nAnd Jessica knew she'd see the baby soon enough -- a blue-eyed cherub brought to\\nthe Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would\\nbe at the celebration and would report on it.\\nIt was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn't have\\nstarted a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave\\nraids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.\\nJessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and\\nthe dangers he faced -- the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen\\nraids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of\\naircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural\\ndangers of the desert -- makers and thirst and dust chasms.\\nShe thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in\\nthese sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they\\nendured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen\\nendured.\\nA dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup\\nupon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.\\nAn offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.\\nShe took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society\\nof our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an\\n\\n\\fanonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? I could alter any poison now\\nbefore it did me harm, or course, but the donor doesn't realize this.\\nShe drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents -- hot and\\ndelicious.\\nAnd she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her\\nprivacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift\\nand not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift -- with\\nonly a slight tinge of fear.\\nAnother element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had\\nthought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she\\nknew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from\\nthe subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people\\ncould never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they\\nhad not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could\\nnot understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single\\norganism.\\nAnd the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.\\nHas Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He's capable,\\nbut accident can strike down even the most capable.\\nThe waiting.\\nIt's the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the\\ndreariness of the waiting overcomes you.\\nThere was all manner of waiting in their lives.\\nMore than two years we've been here, she thought, and twice that number at\\nleast to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the\\nHarkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.\\n\\\"Reverend Mother?\\\"\\nThe voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other\\nwoman in Paul's menage.\\n\\\"Yes, Harah.\\\"\\nThe hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch\\nsandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders.\\nHer black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an\\ninsect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were\\ndrawn into an intense frown.\\nBehind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.\\nSeeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia's\\nresemblance to Paul at that age -- the same wide-eyed solemnity to her questing\\nlook, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle differences,\\ntoo, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child -little more than a toddler -- carried herself with a calmness and awareness\\nbeyond her years. Adults were shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of\\nwords between the sexes. Or they'd catch themselves listening to her half-lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover\\nin her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two-year-old\\nhad ever encountered.\\nHarah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.\\n\\\"Alia.\\\" Jessica motioned to her daughter.\\nThe child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her\\nmother's hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had\\nshared since before Alia's birth. It wasn't a matter of shared thoughts -although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing\\nthe spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate awareness\\nof another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-sympatico that made\\nthem emotionally one.\\nIn the formal manner that befitted a member of her son's household, Jessica\\nsaid: \\\"Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?\\\"\\n\\n\\fWith the same traditional formality, she said: \\\"Subakh un nar. I am well.\\\"\\nThe words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.\\nJessica sensed amusement from Alia.\\n\\\"My brother's ghanima is annoyed with me,\\\" Alia said in her half-lisp.\\nJessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah -- ghanima. In the\\nsubtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant \\\"something acquired in battle\\\"\\nand with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its\\noriginal purpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.\\nHarah scowled at the child. \\\"Don't try to insult me, child. I know my\\nplace.\\\"\\n\\\"What have you done this time, Alia?\\\" Jessica asked.\\nHarah answered; \\\"Not only has she refused to play with the other children\\ntoday, but she intruded where . . . \\\"\\n\\\"I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay's child being born,\\\" Alia\\nsaid. \\\"It's a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he'd cried long\\nenough --\\\"\\n\\\"She came out and touched him,\\\" Harah said, \\\"and he stopped crying. Everyone\\nknows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he's in sietch because\\nhe can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr.\\\"\\n\\\"He'd cried enough,\\\" Alia said. \\\"I just wanted to feel his spark, his life.\\nThat's all. And when he felt me he didn't want to cry anymore.\\\"\\n\\\"It's just made more talk among the people,\\\" Harah said.\\n\\\"Subiay's boy is healthy?\\\" Jessica asked. She saw that something was\\ntroubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.\\n\\\"Healthy as any mother could ask,\\\" Harah said. \\\"They know Alia didn't hurt\\nhim. They didn't so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and\\nwas happy. It was . . . \\\" Harah shrugged.\\n\\\"It's the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?\\\" Jessica asked. \\\"It's the\\nway she speaks of things beyond her years and of things no child her age could\\nknow -- things of the past.\\\"\\n\\\"How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?\\\" Harah\\ndemanded.\\n\\\"But he does!\\\" Alia said, \\\"Subiay's boy looks just like the son of Mitha\\nborn before the parting.\\\"\\n\\\"Alia!\\\" Jessica said. \\\"I warned you.\\\"\\n\\\"But, Mother, I saw it and it was true and . . . \\\"\\nJessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah's face.\\nWhat have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth\\neverything that I knew . . . and more: everything revealed to her out of the\\ncorridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.\\n\\\"It's not just the things she says,\\\" Harah said. \\\"It's the exercises, too:\\nthe way she sits and stares at a rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose,\\nor a muscle on the back of a finger, or --\\\"\\n\\\"Those are the Bene Gesserit training,\\\" Jessica said. \\\"You know that, Harah.\\nWould you deny my daughter her inheritance?\\\"\\n\\\"Reverend Mother, you know these things don't matter to me,\\\" Harah said.\\n\\\"It's the people and the way they mutter. I feel danger in it. They say your\\ndaughter's a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that she's --\\\"\\n\\\"She has so little in common with the other children,\\\" Jessica said. \\\"She's\\nno demon. It's just the --\\\"\\n\\\"Of course she's not!\\\"\\nJessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah's tone, glanced\\ndown at Alia. The child appeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of . . .\\nwaiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.\\n\\\"I respect the fact that you're a member of my son's household,\\\" Jessica\\nsaid. (Alia stirred against her hand.) \\\"You may speak openly with me of\\nwhatever's troubling you.\\\"\\n\\n\\f\\\"I will not be a member of your son's household much longer,\\\" Harah said.\\n\\\"I've waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they\\nreceive as the children of Usul. It's little enough I could give them since it's\\nknown I don't share your son's bed.\\\"\\nAgain Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.\\n\\\"You'd have made a good companion for my son, though,\\\" Jessica said. And she\\nadded to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion . . . not a\\nwife. Jessica's thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came\\nfrom the common talk in the sietch that her son's companionship with Chani had\\nbecome a permanent thing, the marriage.\\nI love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have\\nto step aside for royal necessity. Royal marriages had other reasons than love.\\n\\\"You think I don't know what you plan for your son?\\\" Harah asked.\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" Jessica demanded.\\n\\\"You plan to unite the tribes under Him,\\\" Harah said.\\n\\\"Is that bad?\\\"\\n\\\"I see danger for him . . . and Alia is part of that danger.\\\"\\nAlia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.\\n\\\"I've watched you two together,\\\" Harah said, \\\"the way you touch. And Alia is\\nlike my own flesh because she's sister to one who is like my brother. I've\\nwatched over her and guarded her from the time she was a mere baby, from the\\ntime of the razzia when we fled here. I've seen many things about her.\\\"\\nJessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.\\n\\\"You know what I mean,\\\" Harah said. \\\"The way she knew from the first what we\\nwere saying to her. When has there been another baby who knew the water\\ndiscipline so young? What other baby's first words to her nurse were: 'I love\\nyou, Harah'?\\\"\\nHarah stared at Alia. \\\"Why do you think I accept her insults? I know there's\\nno malice in them.\\\"\\nAlia looked up at her mother.\\n\\\"Yes, I have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother,\\\" Harah said. \\\"I could have\\nbeen of the Sayyadina. I have seen what I have seen.\\\"\\n\\\"Harah . . . \\\" Jessica shrugged. \\\"I don't know what to say.\\\" And she felt\\nsurprise at herself, because this literally was true.\\nAlia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting\\nended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.\\n\\\"We made a mistake,\\\" Alia said. \\\"Now we need Harah.\\\"\\n\\\"It was the ceremony of the seed,\\\" Harah said, \\\"when you changed the Water\\nof Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.\\\"\\nNeed Harah? Jessica asked herself.\\n\\\"Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?\\\"\\nAlia asked.\\n\\\"What would you have her do?\\\" Jessica asked.\\n\\\"She already knows what to do,\\\" Alia said.\\n\\\"I will tell them the truth,\\\" Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old and\\nsad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp\\nfeatures. \\\"I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that\\nshe has never been a little girl.\\\"\\nAlia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of\\nsadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.\\n\\\"I know I'm a freak,\\\" Alia whispered. The adult summation coming from the\\nchild mouth was like a bitter confirmation.\\n\\\"You're not a freak!\\\" Harah snapped. \\\"Who dared say you're a freak?\\\"\\nAgain, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah's\\nvoice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly -- they did need Harah.\\nThe tribe would understand Harah -- both her words and her emotions -- for it\\nwas obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child.\\n\\n\\f\\\"Who said it?\\\" Harah repeated.\\n\\\"Nobody.\\\"\\nAlia used a corner of Jessica's aba to wipe the tears from her face. She\\nsmoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it.\\n\\\"Then don't you say it,\\\" Harah ordered.\\n\\\"Yes, Harah.\\\"\\n\\\"Now,\\\" Harah said, \\\"you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell the\\nothers. Tell me what it is that happened to you.\\\"\\nAlia swallowed, looked up at her mother.\\nJessica nodded.\\n\\\"One day I woke up,\\\" Alia said. \\\"It was like waking from sleep except that I\\ncould not remember going to sleep. I was in a warm, dark place. And I was\\nfrightened.\\\"\\nListening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that\\nday in the big cavern.\\n\\\"When I was frightened,\\\" Alia said, \\\"I tried to escape, but there was no way\\nto escape. Then I saw a spark . . . but it wasn't exactly like seeing it. The\\nspark was just there with me and I felt the spark's emotions . . . soothing me,\\ncomforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was\\nmy mother.\\\"\\nHarah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a look\\nof wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too,\\nwere trying to hear Alia's words.\\nAnd Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks . . .\\nout of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?\\n\\\"Just when I felt safe and reassured,\\\" Alia said, \\\"there, was another spark\\nwith us . . . and everything was happening at once. The other spark was the old\\nReverend Mother. She was . . . trading lives with my mother . . . everything . .\\n. and I was there with them, seeing it all . . . everything. And it was over,\\nand I was them and all the others and myself . . . only it took me a long time\\nto find myself again. There were so many others.\\\"\\n\\\"It was a cruel thing,\\\" Jessica said. \\\"No being should wake into\\nconsciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to\\nyou.\\\"\\n\\\"I couldn't do anything else!\\\" Alia said. \\\"I didn't know how to reject or\\nhide my consciousness . . . or shut if off . . . everything just happened . . .\\neverything . . . \\\"\\n\\\"We didn't know,\\\" Harah murmured. \\\"When we gave your mother the Water to\\nchange, we didn't know you existed within her.\\\"\\n\\\"Don't be sad about it, Harah,\\\" Alia said. \\\"I shouldn't feel sorry for\\nmyself. After all, there's cause for happiness here: I'm a Reverend Mother. The\\ntribe has two Rev . . . \\\"\\nShe broke off, tipping her head to listen.\\nHarah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia,\\nbringing her attention then up to Jessica's face.\\n\\\"Didn't you suspect?\\\" Jessica asked.\\n\\\"Sh-h-h-h,\\\" Alia said.\\nA distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated\\nthem from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now:\\n\\\"Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!\\\"\\nThe chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to\\nthe inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.\\nWhen the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the\\nsadness in her voice: \\\"It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse.\\\"\\n\\\"My family sat in their pool courtyard,\\\" Harah said, \\\"in air bathed by the\\nmoisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree of portyguls,\\nround and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket with mish mish and\\n\\n\\fbaklawa and mugs of liban -- all manner of good things to eat. In our gardens\\nand, in our flocks, there was peace . . . peace in all the land.\\\"\\n\\\"Life was full with happiness until the raiders came,\\\" Alia said.\\n\\\"Blood ran cold at the scream of friends,\\\" Jessica said. And she felt the\\nmemories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.\\n\\\"La, la, la, the women cried,\\\" said Harah.\\n\\\"The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives\\ndripping red from the lives of our men,\\\" Jessica said.\\nSilence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the\\nsietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.\\nPresently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words\\na harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.\\n\\\"We will never forgive and we will never forget,\\\" Harah said.\\nIn the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of\\npeople, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the\\nhangings that shielded her chamber.\\n\\\"Reverend Mother?\\\"\\nA woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of\\nStilgar's wives.\\n\\\"What is it, Tharthar?\\\"\\n\\\"There is trouble, Reverend Mother.\\\"\\nJessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. \\\"Paul . .\\n.\\\" she gasped.\\nTharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a\\npress of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at\\nTharthar -- a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue\\nof her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to\\nreveal the plug scars.\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" Jessica demanded.\\n\\\"There is word from the sand,\\\" Tharthar said. \\\"Usul meets the maker for his\\ntest . . . it is today. The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider\\nby nightfall. The young men are banding for a razzia. They will raid in the\\nnorth and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then. They say they\\nwill force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.\\\"\\nGathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely\\n-- these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The little raids, the certain\\nraids -- these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained them. They\\nfeel their power. They want to fight.\\nTharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.\\nWe know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but there's the core\\nof our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do\\nus. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting's prolonged.\\n\\\"The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be\\nafraid,\\\" Tharthar said.\\nShe lowered her gaze.\\n\\\"So that's the way of it,\\\" Jessica muttered. And she thought: Well I saw it\\ncoming. As did Stilgar.\\nAgain, Tharthar cleared her throat. \\\"Even my brother, Shoab, says it,\\\" she\\nsaid. \\\"They will leave Usul no choice.\\\"\\nThen it has come, Jessica thought. And Paul will have to handle it himself.\\nThe Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.\\nAlia freed her hand from her mother's, said: \\\"I will go with Tharthar and\\nlisten to the young men. Perhaps there is a way.\\\"\\nJessica met Tharthar's gaze, but spoke to Alia: \\\"Go, then. And report to me\\nas soon as you can.\\\"\\n\\\"We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother,\\\" Tharthar said.\\n\\n\\f\\\"We do not want it,\\\" Jessica agreed. \\\"The tribe needs all its strength.\\\" She\\nglanced at Harah. \\\"Will you go with them?\\\"\\nHarah answered the unspoken part of the question: \\\"Tharthar will allow no\\nharm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to\\nshare the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and I.\\\" Harah looked up at\\nTharthar, back to Jessica. \\\"We have an understanding.\\\"\\nTharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: \\\"We must hurry. The young men are\\nleaving.\\\"\\nThey pressed through the hangings, the child's hand in the small woman's\\nhand, but the child seemed to be leading.\\n\\\"If Paul-Muad'Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe,\\\" Harah said.\\n\\\"Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed.\\\"\\n\\\"Times have changed for you, as well,\\\" Jessica said.\\n\\\"You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle,\\\" Harah said. \\\"Usul\\ncould not but win.\\\"\\n\\\"That was my meaning,\\\" Jessica said.\\n\\\"And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment,\\\" Harah said. She\\nshook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. \\\"How wrong you are.\\nPerhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of Usul, that I\\nam jealous of Chani?\\\"\\n\\\"You make your own choice as you are able,\\\" Jessica said.\\n\\\"I pity Chani,\\\" Harah said.\\nJessica stiffened. \\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\n\\\"I know what you think of Chani,\\\" Harah said. \\\"You think she is not the wife\\nfor your son.\\\"\\nJessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. \\\"Perhaps.\\\"\\n\\\"You could be right,\\\" Harah said. \\\"If you are, you may find a surprising\\nally -- Chani herself. She wants whatever is best for Him.\\\"\\nJessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. \\\"Chani's very dear\\nto me,\\\" she said. \\\"She could be no --\\\"\\n\\\"Your rugs are very dirty in here,\\\" Harah said. She swept her gaze around\\nthe floor, avoiding Jessica's eyes. \\\"So many people tramping through here all\\nthe time. You really should have them cleaned more often.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"\\nAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.\\n-from \\\"A Child's History of Muad'Dib\\\" by the Princess Irulan\\nAs Paul fought the 'thopter's controls, he grew aware that he was sorting\\nout the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the\\nbasis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of\\nturbulence, an occasional vortex.\\nThe cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of\\ninstrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his\\ninner sense began to see through the curtain.\\nI must find the right vortex, he thought.\\nFor a long time now he had sensed the storm's power diminishing, but still\\nit shook them. He waited out another turbulence.\\nThe vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul\\ndefied all fear to bank the 'thopter left.\\nJessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.\\n\\\"Paul!\\\" she screamed.\\nThe vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the 'thopter like a\\nchip on a geyser, spewed them up and out--a winged speck within a core of\\nwinding dust lighted by the second moon.\\nPaul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged\\nthem, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert--moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.\\n\\\"We're out of it,\\\" Jessica whispered.\\nPaul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he\\nscanned the night sky.\\n\\\"We've given them the slip,\\\" he said.\\nJessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at\\nthe diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that\\ncompounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed\\nthe passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.\\nIt was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The\\nstorm passed through us and around us. It's gone, but we remain.\\n\\\"I don't like the sound of our wing motion,\\\" Paul said. \\\"We suffered some\\ndamage in there.\\\"\\nHe felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They\\nwere out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient\\nvision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of\\na revelation.\\nHe shivered.\\nThe sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on\\nthe question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was\\nthe spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the\\nlitany, as though the words had a power of their own.\\n\\\"I shall not fear . . . \\\"\\n\\n\\fCause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself\\npoised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the\\nlitany's magic.\\nWords from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: \\\"What senses\\ndo we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?\\\"\\n\\\"There's rock all around,\\\" Jessica said.\\nPaul focused on the 'thopter's launching, shook his head to clear it. He\\nlooked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand\\nahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in\\nthe cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm's doing.\\n\\\"Better set us down on sand,\\\" Jessica said. \\\"The wings might not take full\\nbrake.\\\"\\nHe nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into\\nmoonlight above the dunes. \\\"I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your safety\\nharness.\\\"\\nShe obeyed, thinking: We've water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we\\ncan survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we\\ncan do.\\n\\\"Run for those rocks the instant we're stopped,\\\" Paul said. \\\"I'll take the\\npack.\\\"\\n\\\"Run for . . . \\\" She fell silent, nodded. \\\"Worms.\\\"\\n\\\"Our friends, the worms,\\\" he corrected her. \\\"They'll get this 'thopter.\\nThere'll be no evidence of where we landed.\\\"\\nHow direct his thinking, she thought.\\nThey glided lower . . . lower . . .\\nThere came a rushing sense of motion to their passage--blurred shadows of\\ndunes, rocks lifting like islands. The 'thopter touched a dune top with a soft\\nlurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.\\nHe's killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted\\nherself to admire his competence.\\n\\\"Brace yourself!\\\" Paul warned.\\nHe pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder.\\nHe felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind\\nscreamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings' leaves.\\nAbruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened\\nby the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the 'thopter.\\nThe craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the\\nopposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay\\nstopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.\\nPaul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother,\\nwrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry\\nsmell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother\\nwas free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and\\nout onto the 'thopter's metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its\\nstraps.\\n\\\"Run!\\\" he ordered.\\nHe pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower\\nundercut by sandblast winds.\\nJessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune.\\nShe heard Paul's panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that\\ncurved away toward the rocks.\\n\\\"Follow the ridge,\\\" Paul ordered. \\\"It'll be faster.\\\"\\nThey slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.\\nA new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an\\nabrasive slithering.\\n\\\"Worm,\\\" Paul said.\\nIt grew louder.\\n\\n\\f\\\"Faster!\\\" Paul gasped.\\nThe first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more\\nthan ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.\\nPaul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped\\nhis side as he ran. He took his mother's arm with his other hand. They scrambled\\nonto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\\n\\\"I can't run any farther,\\\" Jessica panted.\\nPaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto\\nthe desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel to their rock island--moonlit\\nripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul's eyes at a\\ndistance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once--a\\nshort loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked\\nornithopter.\\nWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\\nThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own\\npath, questing.\\n\\\"It's bigger than a Guild spaceship,\\\" Paul whispered. \\\"I was told worms grew\\nlarge in the deep desert, but I didn't realize . . . how big.\\\"\\n\\\"Nor I,\\\" Jessica breathed.\\nAgain, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving\\ntrack toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage was lost\\nin gentle sand stirrings around them.\\nPaul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and\\nquoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: \\\"Travel by night and rest in black shade through\\nthe day.\\\" He looked at his mother. \\\"We still have a few hours of night. Can you\\ngo on?\\\"\\n\\\"In a moment.\\\"\\nPaul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its\\nstraps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.\\n\\\"Whenever you're ready,\\\" he said.\\nShe pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. \\\"Which\\ndirection?\\\"\\n\\\"Where this ridge leads.\\\" He pointed.\\n\\\"Deep into the desert,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"The Fremen desert,\\\" Paul whispered.\\nAnd he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient\\nvision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But the set of\\nthe vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared\\ninto his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect\\nregistry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted\\nand approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.\\nIdaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.\\n\\\"Do you see a way to go?\\\" Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.\\n\\\"No,\\\" he said, \\\"But we'll go anyway.\\\"\\nHe settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with\\nbenched ledges climbing away to the south.\\nPaul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.\\nShe noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and\\nparticular--the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were slowed, the\\nwind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go\\nover or go around? The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when\\nnecessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.\\n\\\"Careful here--this ledge is slippery with sand.\\\"\\n\\\"Watch you don't hit your head against this overhang.\\\"\\n\\n\\f\\\"Stay below this ridge; the moon's at our backs and it'd show our movement\\nto anyone out there.\\\"\\nPaul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.\\nJessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul\\npulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It tasted\\nbrackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan--a tall fountain enclosing a\\ncurve of sky, such a richness of moisture that it hadn't been noticed for itself\\n. . . only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside\\nit.\\nTo stop, she thought. To rest . . . truly rest.\\nIt occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment.\\nThere was no mercy where there could be no stopping.\\nPaul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping\\nsurface. Jessica followed with a sigh.\\nThey slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face. Again,\\nthey fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.\\nJessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in\\nsubstances beneath their feet and hands--boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock\\nor pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.\\nThe powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea\\ngravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock flakes cut.\\nAnd the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.\\nPaul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled\\ninto him.\\nHe was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood\\natop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred\\nmeters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves--shadows of angles that\\nlapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of\\nanother escarpment.\\n\\\"Open desert,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"A wide place to cross,\\\" Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter\\ntrap across his face.\\nJessica glanced left and right--nothing but sand below.\\nPaul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of\\nshadows in the moon's passage. \\\"About three or four kilometers across,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Worms,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Sure to be.\\\"\\nShe focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. \\\"Shall\\nwe rest and eat?\\\"\\nPaul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica\\nsupported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him.\\nShe felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.\\n\\\"Here,\\\" he said.\\nHis hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her\\npalm\\nShe swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.\\n\\\"Drink all your water,\\\" Paul said. \\\"Axiom: the best place to conserve your\\nwater is in your body. It keeps your energy up. You're stronger. Trust your\\nstillsuit.\\\"\\nShe obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought\\nthen how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she\\nrecalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, \\\"Better a dry\\nmorsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife.\\\"\\nJessica repeated the words to Paul.\\n\\\"That was Gurney,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\fShe caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead,\\nthought: And well poor Gurney might be dead. The Atreides forces were either\\ndead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.\\n\\\"Gurney always had the right quotation,\\\" Paul said. \\\"I can hear him now:\\n'And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked;\\nand I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of\\nstrangers.' \\\"\\nJessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in\\nher son's voice.\\nPresently, Paul said: \\\"How do you . . . feel?\\\"\\nShe recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: \\\"Your\\nsister won't be born for many months yet. I still feel . . . physically\\nadequate.\\\"\\nAnd she thought: How stiffly formal I speak to my own son! Then, because it\\nwas the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she\\nsearched and found the source of her formality: I'm afraid of my son; I fear his\\nstrangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.\\nPaul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds\\nof the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He\\nrubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.\\n\\\"There's melange spice nearby,\\\" he said.\\nAn eider wind feathered Paul's cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose.\\nBut this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference.\\n\\\"Dawn soon,\\\" he said.\\nJessica nodded.\\n\\\"There's a way to get safely across that open sand,\\\" Paul said. \\\"The Fremen\\ndo it.\\\"\\n\\\"The worms?\\\"\\n\\\"If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,\\\"\\nPaul said. \\\"It'd keep a worm occupied for a time.\\\"\\nShe glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other\\nescarpment. \\\"Four kilometers worth of time?\\\"\\n\\\"Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that\\ndon't attract the worms . . . \\\"\\nPaul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the\\nmysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had\\ncome with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive\\nterror at thought of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his\\nawareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared . . . if . . . if .\\n. .\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\\"It'd have to be sounds without rhythm,\\\" Jessica said.\\n\\\"What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps . . . the sand itself must shift down\\nat times. Worms can't investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested\\nbefore we try it, though.\\\"\\nHe looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the\\nvertical moonshadows there. \\\"It'll be dawn within the hour.\\\"\\n\\\"Where'll we spend the day?\\\" she asked.\\nPaul turned left, pointed. \\\"The cliff curves back north over there. You can\\nsee by the way it's wind-cut that's the windward face. There'll be crevasses\\nthere, deep ones.\\\"\\n\\\"Had we better get started?\\\" she asked.\\nHe stood, helped her to her feet. \\\"Are you rested enough for a climb down? I\\nwant to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp.\\\"\\n\\\"Enough.\\\" She nodded for him to lead the way.\\nHe hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned\\nalong the cliff.\\n\\n\\fIf only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. It'd be such a simple matter to\\njump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open\\ndesert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.\\nThey came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a\\nfissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.\\nPaul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious\\nthe moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world of deeper\\nand deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The\\nfissure narrowed to some ten meters' width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope\\nthat slanted downward into darkness.\\n\\\"Can we do down?\\\" Jessica whispered.\\n\\\"I think so.\\\"\\nHe tested the surface with one foot.\\n\\\"We can slide down,\\\" he said. \\\"I'll go first. Wait until you hear me stop.\\\"\\n\\\"Careful,\\\" she said.\\nHe stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an\\nalmost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.\\nThere came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the\\nslope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away\\nto silence.\\n\\\"Mother?\\\" he said.\\nThere was no answer.\\n\\\"Mother?\\\"\\nHe dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging,\\nthrowing sand like a wild man. \\\"Mother!\\\" he gasped. \\\"Mother, where are you?\\\"\\nAnother cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He\\nwrenched himself out of it.\\nShe's been caught in the sandslide, he thought. Buried in it. I must be calm\\nand work this out carefully. She won't smother immediately. She'll compose\\nherself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows I'll dig for\\nher.\\nIn the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating\\nof his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments\\ncould write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed\\nitself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with\\nthe fractional second of real time required for the total recall.\\nPresently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he\\nfound the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig,\\nmoving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of fabric came\\nunder his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm,\\nexposed her face.\\n\\\"Do you hear me?\\\" he whispered.\\nNo answer.\\nHe dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he\\ndetected a slow heartbeat.\\nBindu suspension, he told himself.\\nHe cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders\\nand pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could,\\nfeeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with\\nthe effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of\\nthe fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering\\nrun as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was\\nmagnified within the rock walls.\\nHe stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert's\\nmarching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the sand,\\nuttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.\\nShe awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.\\n\\n\\f\\\"I knew you'd find me,\\\" she whispered.\\nHe looked back up the fissure. \\\"It might have been kinder if I hadn't.\\\"\\n\\\"Paul!\\\"\\n\\\"I lost the pack,\\\" he said. \\\"It's buried under a hundred tons of sand . . .\\nat least.\\\"\\n\\\"Everything?\\\"\\n\\\"The spare water, the stilltent--everything that counts.\\\" He touched a\\npocket. \\\"I still have the paracompass.\\\" He fumbled at the waist sash. \\\"Knife and\\nbinoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we'll die.\\\"\\nIn that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left\\nbeyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the open\\ndesert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the\\nrocks.\\nBut Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul's face. She edged her\\nvoice with scorn, said: \\\"Is this the way you were taught?\\\"\\n\\\"Don't you understand?\\\" he asked. \\\"Everything we need to survive in this\\nplace is under that sand.\\\"\\n\\\"You found me,\\\" she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.\\nPaul squatted back on his heels.\\nPresently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking\\nthe looseness of the sand.\\n\\\"If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a\\nhole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack. Water\\nmight do it, but we don't have enough water for . . .\\\" He broke off, then:\\n\\\"Foam.\\\"\\nJessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyper-functioning of\\nhis mind.\\nPaul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as\\nhis eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened\\npatch of sand below them.\\n\\\"Spice,\\\" he said. \\\"Its essence--highly alkaline. And I have the paracompass.\\nIts power pack is acid-base.\\\"\\nJessica sat up straight against the rock.\\nPaul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted\\nsurface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the desert's floor.\\nShe watched the way he walked, breaking his stride--step . . . pause, step-step . . . slide . . . pause . . .\\nThere was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of\\nthe desert moved here.\\nPaul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his\\nrobe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of\\nJessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his\\nknife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts\\non it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism came out next, leaving an\\nempty dished compartment in the instrument.\\n\\\"You'll need water,\\\" Jessica said.\\nPaul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it\\ninto the dished compartment.\\nIf this fails, that's water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won't matter\\nthen, anyway.\\nWith his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the\\nwater. They foamed slightly, subsided.\\nJessica's eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of\\nhawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the open\\nwater.\\nGreat Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!\\n\\n\\fPaul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button\\nwhich gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in one\\nhand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying\\nthe lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He\\nwaded part way up the slope, kicking off sand rivulets, spurts of dust.\\nPresently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass,\\nshook the instrument case.\\nGreen foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul\\naimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand\\nbeneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.\\nJessica moved to a position below him, called out: \\\"May I help?\\\"\\n\\\"Come up and dig,\\\" he said. \\\"We've about three meters to go. It's going to\\nbe a near thing.\\\" As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.\\n\\\"Quickly,\\\" Paul said. \\\"No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.\\\"\\nJessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into\\nthe hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.\\nAs Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the\\nsand down the slope. \\\"How deep?\\\" she panted.\\n\\\"About three meters,\\\" he said. \\\"And I can only approximate the position. We\\nmay have to widen this hole.\\\" He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand.\\n\\\"Slant your digging backward. Don't go straight down.\\\"\\nJessica obeyed.\\nSlowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the\\nbasin and still no sign of the pack.\\nCould I have miscalculated? Paul asked himself. I'm the one that panicked\\noriginally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?\\nHe looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion\\nremained.\\nJessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her\\ncheek. Her eyes met Paul's.\\n\\\"The upper face,\\\" Paul said. \\\"Gently, now.\\\" He added another pinch of spice\\nto the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica's hands as she began\\ncutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole. On the second pass, her\\nhands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with\\na plastic buckle.\\n\\\"Don't move any more of it,\\\" Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.\\n\\\"We're out of foam.\\\"\\nJessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.\\nPaul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said:\\n\\\"Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I'm going to pull you to the\\nside and downhill. Don't let go of that strap. We won't get much more spill from\\nthe top. This slope has stabilized itself. All I'm going to aim for is to keep\\nyour head free of the sand. Once that hole's filled, we can dig you out and pull\\nup the pack.\\\"\\n\\\"I understand,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Ready?\\\"\\n\\\"Ready.\\\" She tensed her fingers on the strap.\\nWith one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as\\nthe foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had subsided, Jessica\\nremained buried to the waist, her left arm and shoulder still under the sand,\\nher chin protected on a fold of Paul's robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain\\nput on it.\\n\\\"I still have the strap,\\\" she said.\\nSlowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap.\\n\\\"Together,\\\" he said. \\\"Steady pressure. We mustn't break it.\\\"\\n\\n\\fMore sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared\\nthe surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand. Together then they\\npulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.\\nIn a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack\\nbetween them.\\nPaul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked\\nto her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a target for\\nballs of wet, green sand.\\n\\\"You look a mess,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"You're not so pretty yourself,\\\" she said.\\nThey started to laugh, then sobered.\\n\\\"That shouldn't have happened,\\\" Paul said. \\\"I was careless.\\\"\\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.\\n\\\"I'll put up the tent,\\\" he said. \\\"Better slip off that robe and shake it\\nout.\\\" He turned away, taking the pack.\\nJessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.\\n\\\"There's anchor holes in the rock,\\\" Paul said. \\\"Someone's tented here\\nbefore.\\\"\\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place-deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away--far\\nenough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a\\ncrossing.\\nShe turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere\\nblending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his\\nbinoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the\\noil lenses on the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open\\nsand.\\nJessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing\\ninto sand rivers and canyons.\\n\\\"There are growing things over there,\\\" he said.\\nJessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up\\nbeside Paul.\\n\\\"There,\\\" he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the\\nother.\\nShe looked where he pointed.\\n\\\"Saguaro,\\\" she said. \\\"Scrawny stuff.\\\"\\n\\\"There may be people nearby,\\\" Paul said.\\n\\\"That could be the remains of a botanical testing station,\\\" she warned.\\n\\\"This is pretty far south into the desert,\\\" he said. He lowered his\\nbinoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his\\nlips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. \\\"This has the feeling\\nof a Fremen place,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?\\\" she asked.\\n\\\"Kynes promised their help.\\\"\\nBut there's desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. I felt\\nsome of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.\\nShe closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a\\nscene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan--she and the\\nDuke Leto, before Paul's birth. They'd flown over the southern jungles, above\\nthe weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen\\nthe ant lines in the greenery--man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there'd been the white petals of\\ntrimaran dhows.\\nAll of it gone.\\nJessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of\\nthe day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the\\n\\n\\fopen sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through\\ncheap glass.\\nA spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure.\\nThe sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were\\nbeginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sandfall was gone, she still\\nheard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.\\n\\\"Worm,\\\" Paul whispered.\\nIt came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored.\\nA twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of\\nvision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then\\nit was gone, coursing off to the left.\\nThe sound diminished, died.\\n\\\"I've seen space frigates that were smaller,\\\" Paul whispered.\\nShe nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed\\nthere remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them,\\nbeckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.\\n\\\"When we've rested,\\\" Jessica said, \\\"we should continue with your lessons.\\\"\\nHe suppressed a sudden anger, said: \\\"Mother, don't you think we could do\\nwithout . . .\\\"\\n\\\"Today you panicked,\\\" she said. \\\"You know your mind and bindu-nervature\\nperhaps better than I do, but you've much yet to learn about your body's prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and I can teach you\\nabout this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body.\\nYou need review of the hands. We'll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and\\ntip sensitivity.\\\" She turned away. \\\"Come, into the tent, now.\\\"\\nHe flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the\\nsphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination .\\n. . that he must agree.\\nWhatever has been done to me, I've been a party to it, he thought.\\nReview of the hand!\\nHe looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such\\ncreatures as that worm.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
